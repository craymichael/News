Paris/London/Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser , who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic data isn?t enough to change the pace of the central bank?s asset purchases.
?It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,? Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed?s tapering of its stimulus programme. ?Given the fact that we?ve embarked on measured reductions, it?s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we?re doing. It?s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.?
The Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.
New York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a ?reasonably favorable? outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a ?considerable time.?
The US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.
No Whip-Saw
Improvement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.
Policy shouldn?t be ?whip-sawed from month to month,? Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were ?encouraging,? though they follow other data in the previous two months that were ?weak,? he said.
Yellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.
The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn?t find work.
Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank?s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg

Fed's Plosser: Nasty Weather Has Curbed Job Growth,http://www.moneynews.com/Economy/federal-reserve-charles-plosser-weather-job-growth/2014/03/10/id/557011,Moneynews,"Fed's Plosser: Nasty Weather Has Curbed Job Growth

Severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest a bit of weakness in the labor market is only temporary.
In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser pointed to U.S. payroll gains in December, January and February. ""All three of these numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter weather,"" he said according to prepared remarks.
A government report on Friday showed U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month after creating 129,000 new positions in January. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.
Plosser is a long-time critic of the Fed's aggressive bond-buying program, which is meant to spur hiring and economic growth, but which policymakers have trimmed in measured steps despite some weak growth in jobs, manufacturing and retail sales in the world's largest economy so far this year.
Aside from the reference to the jobs report, Plosser's speech was largely the same as a speech he gave in London on March 6.

Central bank may find itself behind the curve, Philly Fed boss says
By
GabrieleParussini
WilliamHorobin
PARISn ? The Federal Reserve may have to accelerate the pace of tapering to take into account the economic pickup currently ongoing in the U.S. and the improving forecast for the near future, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said Monday.
?We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,? Plosser told a panel in Paris. ?Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts.?
Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.
As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.
But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.
?If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,? Plosser said.
He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy.
?Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,? he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

ECB unlikely to end sterilization of SMP purchases: traders

BANGALORE The European Central Bank will not stop sterilizing bond purchases it made at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis, a majority of euro money market traders polled by Reuters said.
The ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened.
In order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it ""sterilizes"" the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds.
Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.
Some economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday's monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates.
In the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be ""relatively limited"".
The poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB's three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week.
The euro zone's central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks' coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints.
Banks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations.
This week's repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc's financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would.
Of those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year.
The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.
Eighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.

EU's half-baked bank union could work,http://blogs.reuters.com/hugo-dixon/2014/03/10/eus-half-baked-bank-union-could-work/,Reuters UK \(blog\),"By Hugo Dixon
March 10, 2014
The European Union?s half-baked banking union could be made to work ? even though it wasn?t strictly needed to solve the euro zone?s problems and what has been agreed isn?t what the designers wanted.
The original advocates of banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro collapsing during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well-funded, euro-wide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong euro-wide safety net would be able to bail them out.
During the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That?s why banking union enthusiasts wanted euro-wide support systems.
In the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of banking union that hadn?t previously got much attention, centralised supervision of banks, and nixed the idea of common deposit insurance. It didn?t want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries? banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a euro-wide safety net for bust banks ? though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.
Despite all this, banking union doesn?t have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone doesn?t actually need one.
In 2012 much was made of the ?doom loop? that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: bust banks dragged down their governments if the latter had to bail them out; and bust states dragged down their banks if the latter had bought too many of their bonds.
This doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is by euro-wide bailouts. There are better alternatives.
Look, first, at the problem of bust banks infecting their governments. This is only a problem if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they don?t get in trouble in the first place; and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.
That, indeed, is the broad programme that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital, ?bailing in? bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down if necessary.
The EU is doing all this too. But it didn?t require banking union to push it forward.
That said, the ECB could speed up some of these initiatives.
First, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what are known as ?macroprudential? powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like jack up banks? capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.
The snag is too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the ECB will have two units ? the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity over who is going to do what.
Second, many banks don?t have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt, so that taxpayers don?t have to ride to the rescue.
This can be done without banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations has asked for a global proposal later this year. The ECB should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.
Then there?s the matter of avoiding situations where banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system ? and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up ?resolution plans? that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the knacker?s yard without too much contagion.
Again, banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the ECB will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks? resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions ? and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is needed to stop the too big to fail phenomenon.
Now look at the other half of the doom loop: how weak sovereigns infect their banks. Yet again, banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can only be dealt with if lenders are told they can?t hold more than a certain amount of their own governments? bonds.
The ECB would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global regime. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks don?t have such a need to follow suit. So the ECB may, at some point, have to face going it alone.
It won?t be easy for the ECB to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone?s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for purpose.

The European Union?s to-do list isn?t long this week, but anyone interested in financial regulation should get ready for some late nights. The bloc is pushing for a final deal on a new bank-resolution framework for the euro zone and more transparency on foreign bank accounts. The crisis in Ukraine will certainly also occupy minds in Brussels.

"China's trade deficit and structural worries in Europe, among the main issues",http://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/strategic-currency-briefing/2014/03/10/,FXstreet.com,"Mar 10 2014, 12:37 GMT
China's trade deficit and structural worries in Europe, among the main issues
Follow Following
Outlook
Attention is focused on China?s trade deficit and growth possibly falling far short of target, but another bit of data over the weekend should not be neglected?China's inflation rate dropped to 2% y/y in Feb, from 2.5% in Jan and 2.6% in 2013, the same as 2012. As everyone notes repeatedly, you can?t trust Chinese data, but if we were to trust the latest inflation data, we should start worrying about deflation instead of inflation. The PBOC target is 3.5%, by the way. Suppliers to China?like Australia?are not failing to notice. A global slowdown inspired by a Chinese slowdown is back on the fear-list, along with the inevitable suggestion that the motive for devaluation is the classic one, to promote exports, in the guise of corralling speculators.
The other big issue is the collection of worries about Europe?s institutional infrastructure. We pretty much stopped worrying about it when the peripheral sovereign debt crisis abated, but the inability to work together to put a bank failure mechanism in place is a pretty big failure. The bank examinations, to be followed by stress tests, have to be credible, too. Meanwhile, the Europeans can?t get their act together on sanctions against Russia, either.
We believe Merkel when she says sanctions are a real possibility, but the French are not willing to give up their sale of warships, and evading sanctions is a time-honored business practice in many countries. Europe has long preferred to spend public money on social programs rather than defense, and why not, since the US has been willing to take that expense. But at some point the absence of a coherent European foreign policy is damaging to reputations. As we have noted many times before, a reserve currency is classically the currency of the top military power of the day. The eurozone is trying to redefine a reserve currency as coming from the bloc that has the gold standard of fiscal excellence. It?s an interesting concept and one that is working so far, but it?s not inconceivable that Russia/Ukraine may derail it.
Finally, at least we have a complaint about the too-strong euro from a top figure, ECB executive Noyer. He said ""It is clear that when the euro starts to strengthen it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and additional downward pressure on inflation. Both cases aren't warranted at the moment. We are clearly not very happy at the moment.""
Noyer says everything is on track and there is no need for the ECB to take any of the many possible actions if ?prospects deteriorate or its economy is hit by a slowdown elsewhere in the world.? Meanwhile, Noyer claims a plan is on track for French banks to securitize bundles of small business loans, possibly as early as end-March or April and forming a model for the rest of Europe.
Gee, what could go wrong? Well, it?s one way to get non-performings off bank balance sheets. Nobody knows or is willing to disclose how bad the bank situation is in Europe. Draghi is probably sweating over this Achilles heel.
The calendar is light this week until Thursday, when we get the usual weekly jobless claims and retail sales. Until then, everyone will watch Russia/Ukraine, China and the European Parliament, all imprenetrable institutions with untrustworthy news bites. This is the ideal environment for a little dollar strength, or at least a decent Tuesday pullback. (Note that the USD/CAD bounced off support in a textbook-perfect response to an oversold condition.

Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Chinese exports tumble.?Chinese exports   fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6%   gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in   February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit   since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year   holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data.   ""Despite our belief that the   actual trade situation is better than official   data?suggests, the   disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese   yuan(CNY) and the GDP   growth outlook for Q1 2014,"" say economists at Standard   Chartered.
Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer   price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing   from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing   market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's   producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier,   marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year   drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.
Copper falls.? Copper futures slid   more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China.   However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading   near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.
Quiet markets.?Futures point to a   quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P   500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from   Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and   the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of   Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the   Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell   2.9%.
Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data   suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in   the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate.   Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from   5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main   drags on the headline number.
Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a   record current account deficit in January of ?1.589 trillion. The   deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade   deficit, which widened to ?2.345 trillion fom ?1.047 trillion.   ""Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next   April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration   of the balance of payments,"" says?Osamu Takashima, a Citi   strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of   the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month   high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence   conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest   confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to   13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market   economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take ? the   consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this   month.
Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data   from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing   decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of   2013. ""International banking activity was characterised by lower   credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013,   mirroring developments in the previous quarter,"" said the BIS in   its Quarterly Review   published Sunday . ""Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466   billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this   contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late   2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most   pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or   4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres   ($35 billion or 1.7%).""
Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian   military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the   weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international   watchdogs who tried to enter the region.?""Ukraine remains very much a potential   dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for   safe haven flow,"" write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a   note to clients this morning. ""For now, though, the market looks to still   be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle   as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports   informing the market rather than any possible concern over   possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports   across Ukraine).""
ECB not happy with euro   strength.?ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of   France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is   not happy with the euro's recent strength.?""It?s a   very important input in the economic development and inflation   development,"" Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with   Manus Cranny in Paris. ""When the euro tends to strengthen, it   creates additional downward pressure on the economy and   inflation, which in both cases isn?t warranted. So we?re not   happy at the moment."" The Governing Council declined to announce   any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting   last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's   comments.

Eurozone banks' sovereign exposure hits new high,http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_10/03/2014_538029,Kathimerini,"Eurozone banks' sovereign exposure hits new high
By Christopher Whittall & Gareth Gore
LONDON - Banks in the eurozone are now more exposed to government debt than at any time since the financial crisis began, with many increasingly using their balance sheets to prop up ailing governments, deepening the bank-sovereign link that has already pushed a number of countries and lenders into bailouts.
Banks in the region now hold about 1.75 trillion euros in government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to European Central Bank data. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the entire banking system is now on loan to governments.
Although the ECB has said it is keen to break what it terms the sovereign-bank nexus, analysts warn that its hands are tied. European governments need - and many encourage - their banks to finance growing public debt piles because many simply do not have enough alternative buyers after an exodus of foreign investors.
""The sovereign-bank nexus is growing and it is a concern,"" said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan. ""The ECB and regulators want to reduce this risk, but they know they can't right now because the region is only just emerging from a debt crisis. If debt sustainability issues resurface in the future, it will be a problem for heavily exposed banks.""
Since the 1980s, global banking regulations have enshrined incentives to hold government debt by making it zero risk-weighted. The Basel Committee chose not to change these zero weightings when the rules were last updated in 2010. Fitch said the latest rulebook even ""turbocharges"" previous risk weightings.
""The reason that government bonds are zero risk-weighted by regulators is partly political; it is not how we weight them in our credit analysis,"" said Bridget Gandy, a bank analyst at Fitch, who added that underdeveloped capital markets often necessitate the bank-sovereign nexus.
""Somebody has to buy government bonds, and many countries have traditionally leant on their banking systems to do exactly that. Only once a country's capital markets develop, with a healthy insurance and pension sector, do you increase the pool of buyers, and some countries aren't there yet.""
The ECB is blamed by many for having facilitated an increase in exposures, providing banks with cheap loans initially at just 1 percent - falling recently to 0.25 percent - which they can pump into government securities that over the past few years have yielded 7 percent and more - in effect an easy profit.
Cash-strapped peripheral banks - many of which have been shut out of primary markets - have welcomed the opportunity to plug capital shortfalls, ploughing over half of their net borrowings from the ECB's emergency longer-term refinancing operations facility into bonds, while lending a mere 13% to the real economy, according to JP Morgan figures.
The carry trade is estimated to be worth between 5 billion euros and 20 billion euros a year to Spanish and Italian banks, with many firms using the trade not only to hide deep losses, but also as a way to build up capital buffers - in effect using ECB funds to save private shareholders from being diluted.
Banks' holdings of government bonds have risen by 355 billion euros - or about 25 percent - since the liquidity injections in late 2011 and early 2012. Banks in fiscally weak countries have increased their purchases the most, with Italian, Portuguese and Spanish banks increasing their holdings by 62 percent, 52 percent and 45 percent respectively.
""Policymakers say that they need to break this negative feedback loop, but as a side effect, ECB policies have enabled banks to load up on government debt which has furthered the link between banks and their home sovereign,"" said Stefan Best, a bank analyst at Standard & Poor's.
""The LTRO allowed banks to borrow huge amounts of cash from the central bank at low interest rates and several have used that money to buy government debt to bolster revenues,"" said Best. ""Governments have not objected to them doing this.""
It is not the first time that banks have piled into a sovereign-debt-linked carry trade in search of easy money. In the previous decade, many banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank bought billions in Greek debt in order to cash in on the extra yield offered.
That trade spectacularly backfired when Athens was forced to restructure its private debts, leaving those four banks with multi-billion euro losses and the Greek and Cypriot banking systems in need of mass recapitalizations after organizations bailing out the country decided to impose a haircut on Greek debt.
Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of last year was 133 percent, higher than the 129 percent that Greece had in the last full year before it asked for a bailout. Spain also has a debt higher than its annual GDP. According to the IMF, there have been 600 cases of sovereign debt restructuring since the 1950s in 95 countries, often with debt levels lower than Spain and Italy.
Although banks' exposure to government debt is now lower than in the 1990s, when banks in countries including Belgium and Greece devoted more than 20 percent of their balance sheets to sovereign debt, public debt levels across Europe are much higher today, increasing the risk of a debt restructuring.
In Spain and Italy, exposures have increased rapidly in recent years. Spanish banks now hold 297 billion euros of government debt, equivalent to 9.4 percent of total industry assets and up from less than 3 percent in late 2008. Italian banks hold 407 billion euros, roughly 10 percent of total assets and up from 4.6 percent in late 2008.
That growing exposure would increase the risk and cost of mass bank recapitalization in the event of a government debt restructuring.
""The ECB is keen to reduce this dangerous link but it can't escape the fact that many governments still need banks to buy their debt,"" said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at RBS. ""The purpose of banks isn't to finance their national governments, but they are being encouraged to do precisely that."" [Reuters]

Forex Market: EUR/USD retreats from 2-1/2-year highs as stronger euro seen  ...,http://www.binarytribune.com/2014/03/10/forex-market-eurusd-retreats-from-2-12-year-highs-as-stronger-euro-seen-creating-pressure-on-economy/,Binary Tribune,"Forex Market: EUR/USD retreats from 2-1/2-year highs as stronger euro seen creating pressure on economy
March 10, 2014 12:38 pm
The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone?s economy.
EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair?s strongest since October 2011.
?It?s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,? Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. ?When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn?t warranted. So we?re not happy at the moment.?
The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone?s exporters.
Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank?s price-stability objective.
On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB?s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro?s demand.
The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank?s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.
In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts? projections for a 0.7% increase.
At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts? forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January?s 0.8% increase. February?s reading was also the strongest since September.
While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.
Meanwhile, greenback?s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation?s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn?t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.
The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.
?The fundamentals are good,? Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. ?Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they?ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.?
At the same time, the deficit on United States? trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.
Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair?s strongest since January 23rd.

REFILE-Bad loan triggers key feature in ECB bank test announcement- sources
By Laura Noonan
DUBLIN, March 10 The European Central Bank's stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations in an announcement on Tuesday on how it will test the balance sheets of the euro zone's largest banks, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.
The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors deciding whether they need billions of euros of extra capital.
The tests are being done to restore investor confidence and clean up any lingering problems in the euro zone's banks before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.
The methods some euro zone banks use to decide if a loan has turned sour will fall short of those in the ECB's review of banks' loan books, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
The rules will require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said, and will also set the banks estimates of loan losses against 'challenger models' created by external auditors.
The ECB declined to comment.

UPDATE 1-ECB to reveal bad loan hurdles for euro zone bank test -sources
* Impairments and 'hard to value' assets key areas
* Loans pitted against auditors' 'challenger models'
* Collateral not valued for over a year must be revalued
By Laura Noonan
DUBLIN, March 10 The European Central Bank's stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone's largest banks when it details on Tuesday how it will test balance sheets, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.
The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets. Estimates of the capital shortfall range from 280 billion euros ($388.13 billion)to as much as 770 billion.
The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.
As well as the initial review on whether banks' assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises.
A document detailing the tests' methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches.
""It will terrify them, even though they've got a reasonable idea of what's coming,"" one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages.
The ECB declined to comment.
The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in Tuesday's announcement would be the ECB's view of when loans become impaired, and the way 'hard to value assets' are treated.
For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said.
A third source said that while the ECB's decision on impairment triggers was ""reasonable"" some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB's list of definitions of indicators for impairment.
Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen. ""Triggers can be subjective,"" the second source said.
If a loan's status is changed from performing to non-performing, it would have a higher probability of default, some thing that would force a bank to set aside more capital to provide for higher likely losses.
Banks' estimates on loan losses will be pitted against 'challenger models' created by external auditors - carrying out the tests on behalf of supervisors - an approach first tried in Ireland's balance sheet assessment in late 2013, two of the sources said.
Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones.
The rules also require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said.
Beyond loans, the ECB's treatment of 'Level 3 assets', a broad group of assets that are difficult to value, will also be closely watched. Those Level 3 assets include derivatives and also include assets such as real estate holdings banks have acquired through foreclosures, their participations in private equity deals and special investment vehicles.
The ECB has taken care to prevent any leaks. Recipients of details of the review face fines of 100,000 euros for leaks and copies have been water-marked with the name of its owner, the sources said.

An anti-government protester sets up a barricade next to a burning kiosk during a protest at Altamira square in Caracas March 9, 2014. Latin American foreign ministers will meet next week to discuss the unrest in Venezuela that has left at least 20 dead and convulsed the South American OPEC nation, diplomatic sources said on Friday.
Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. ""Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan (CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014,"" say economists at Standard Chartered.
Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.
Copper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.
Quiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.
Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.
Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of ?1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to ?2.345 trillion fom ?1.047 trillion. ""Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments,"" says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take - the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.
Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of 2013. ""International banking activity was characterised by lower credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013, mirroring developments in the previous quarter,"" said the BIS in its Quarterly Review published Sunday . ""Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466 billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or 4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres ($35 billion or 1.7%).""
Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. ""Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow,"" write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. ""For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine).""
ECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. ""It's a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,"" Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. ""When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn't warranted. So we're not happy at the moment."" The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.
***
Below is a Business Insider Q&A with Aurelija Augulyte, a macro strategist at Nordea Markets.
***
BUSINESS INSIDER: To what extent do you think poor weather has impacted this winter's economic data?
AURELIJA AUGULYTE: 35%.
BI: What's the big story that nobody is talking about right now?
AA: Few are talking about the true risks of domestic debt crisis potential in Asia. Asian EM FX is still perceived as a ""safe haven"" on wrong comparisons with previous classical EM crises. This time is different. Asian EM FX are most overvalued. If they are forced to defend their currencies at some point, this will result in unwelcome tightening of monetary conditions (essentially the reverse of what has been happening until recently, resulting in rapid domestic credit expansion).
BI: Are you optimistic about Janet Yellen as Fed chair?
AA: Yes, she is consistent, and the ""Yellen put"" should be at work to ensure that any correction in stock markets won't be too deep (up to 15%).
BI: The stock market is roaring back to all-time highs. Do issues in EM not have as big an impact on U.S. markets as people argued a few weeks ago?
AA: They should. But we haven't seen an EM crisis yet - only localized FX adjustments. No big change in credit spreads yet. Thus no spillover to global credit, liquidity premia and volatility. Still pending!
BI: What's something you'll be watching this week and next?
AA: If not watching, then listening to the multiple speeches from Fed members. Their take on recent data weakness. Data-wise I think everything will be seen through the ""it's weather, stupid"" filter by markets, still.

PARIS Price stability is under threat in major economies due to low inflation, warranting action from central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday.
Noyer, who is governor of the Bank of France, warned that ""permanent and deep forces"" were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world.
""Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,"" Noyer told a conference at the French central bank.
Noyer cited vast slack in many economies as a source of low inflation as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.

UPDATE 1-Central banks must contain threat from low prices -Noyer
* Noyer sees ""permanent and deep forces"" weighing on inflation
* Euro strength adding to downward inflation pressures   (Adds details on ECB action)
PARIS, March 10 Price stability is under threat in major economies from low inflation, warranting action by central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday.
Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, warned that ""permanent and deep forces"" were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world.
""Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,"" Noyer told a conference at the French central bank.
Noyer cited slack in many economies as a source of low inflation, as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.
""The recent appreciation of the euro has had indeed a strong disinflationary impact,"" Noyer added. The euro rose in recent days to 1.39 to the dollar, its highest since late 2011, after the European Central Bank left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday.
The Eurostat EU statistics agency estimated euro zone inflation held steady in February at 0.8 percent, well below the ECB's target of close to but less than 2.0 percent.
Noyer said he did not currently see deflation - what he described as a ""pernicious spiral"" downward in prices that chokes consumption and investment - in the euro zone and that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in positive territory.
The ECB's inflation target was meant to provide a cushion against negative shocks to the economy that could drive inflation lower, Noyer said. The euro zone was vulnerable without a buffer, he said.
Against that background, the ECB's Governing Council has made it explicit that its members expect to keep interest rates at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.
Such forward guidance is a relatively new tool the ECB has called on to influence the economy. Noyer said it was unlikely central banks would go back to relying solely on their conventional tool, short-term interest rates.
But even with more levers available to central banks than in the past, Noyer warned that there were limits to what monetary policy could do.
""The longer interest rates are kept at low levels, the greater the risk for financial stability,"" he said.   (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Larry King)

Failing banks focus of EU talks,http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/failing-banks-focus-of-eu-talks-261384.html,Irish Examiner,"Failing banks focus of EU talks
Monday, March 10, 2014
By Jan Strupczewski and Martin Santa, Reuters
European Union governments and parliamentarians will try to reach a compromise this week on how to wind down failing banks in marathon talks intended to settle who decides to close banks and who picks up the bill.
A deal in the negotiations, set to span three days, would be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for all eurozone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one common pot of money to pay for it.
The union, and the thorough clean-up of banks? books that will accompany it, is meant to restore banks? confidence in one another and boost lending to other businesses and households.
New lending has been throttled by banks? efforts to raise capital and reduce the bad loans that proliferated in the recession triggered by the global financial crisis and deepened by the eurozone?s own sovereign debt crisis.
Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the single supervisor for all eurozone banks from November.
But talks on a single European agency to wind up or close failing banks, and on a single fund to back it up, have entered a crucial stage: EU governments, represented by finance ministers of the 28-nation bloc, and the European Parliament must reach a deal next week.
If they don?t, there won?t be enough time to complete the legislative process for the resolution mechanism before the last sitting of the current parliament in mid-April. The key law would be delayed by at least seven months, probably more.
?The ground is very well prepared, now we have to show political will. We will stay there (in the meeting) as long as it takes to find a solution,? one EU official involved in the preparations for the talks said.
?It?s clear to all EU member states that if we want to achieve an agreement there?s only one direction to go ? to try to accommodate the parliament,? the official said.
The problem is that European governments and the European Parliament want different things.
EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the eurozone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that decision must be signed into law by the EU?s executive Commission and by all the finance ministers.
The European Parliament wants no involvement of EU finance ministers, arguing it would politicise the process.
Parliament also wants the ECB ? the supervisor of all banks ? to be the only institution that can declare a bank is failing and that its fate has to be resolved. EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.
Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.
The fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around ?55bn.

Poking the eurozone bear,http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2014/march/poking-the-eurozone-bear/79982.aspx,European Voice,"Updated
1/15/16, 5:41 PM CET
The conventional wisdom is that, when confronted by a bear, you should lie motionless until it loses interest (or assumes that you are dead) and leaves you alone. But there are different species of bear, with some more likely to be deterred by bold, purposeful action. The question is how to determine the right approach when terror incarnate is staring you in the face.
This scenario is helpful for thinking about the eurozone as it attempts to survive its next round of trials ? beginning with the European Parliament election in May. Can it continue simply to ?lie still?, hoping that no new shocks arise that diminish its economic health, if not threaten its survival?
Some take the sanguine view that the current ?lie still? approach is adequate to ensure that the eurozone economy does more than avoid decline. From their perspective, Germany?s decision over the last three years to permit actual and prospective transfers just large enough to prevent financial meltdown will somehow be enough to enable the eurozone finally to begin to recover from a half-decade of recession and stagnation.
But the fact is that these transfers ? that is, European Stability Mechanism-financed bail-out programmes and the European Central Bank?s prospective ?outright monetary transactions? (OMT) bond-buying scheme ? can do little more than fend off collapse. They cannot boost economic output, because they are conditional upon recipient countries? continued pursuit of internal devaluation (lowering domestic wages and prices).
Reinvigorating the eurozone economy requires a more radical effort to resolve the inter-linked sovereign-debt and banking crises. Specifically, it demands sovereign-debt mutualisation through Eurobonds, and thus the elimination of eurozone countries? fiscal sovereignty, and a full-fledged banking union with recapitalisation authority and shared deposit insurance ? a far cry from the arrangement that has been agreed.
If Europe?s leaders continue to choose mild palliatives over bold tactics, the best-case scenario is a lacklustre recovery, with GDP growing at a 1%-2% annual rate. Unfortunately, this best case probably is not enough to prevent future sovereign-debt defaults in countries like Italy, Spain, and eventually even France. In other words, at some point, lying still will no longer be an option.
In fact, eurozone leaders might be spurred into action even sooner. While the prospect of OMT seems to be keeping financial shocks at bay, at least for now, a political shock seems increasingly likely, with voters reacting against the internal-devaluation policies that are fuelling high unemployment and undermining living standards. The upcoming European Parliament election could be just such a shock.
As it stands, Europe?s political class is committed to internal devaluation in all of the troubled eurozone economies. The alternative approach ? dismantling the eurozone to allow for external devaluations ? has thus become the playground of hitherto marginal political parties, which are now surging ahead in opinion polls.
In France, the groups concerned ? the National Front and the Union of the Left ? represent political extremes. In Italy, a more ideologically neutral anti-establishment force may arise, with a much sharper anti-euro focus than Beppe Grillo?s populist Five Star Movement, which emerged last year to become the country?s third-largest political force. As these parties gain traction, the euro?s chances of survival diminish.
The predicament of Europe?s political establishment stems from a combination of irrational fear and vain ambition. This is particularly apparent in France, where the monetary union has often been viewed as a tool for harnessing Germany?s economic strength to project power worldwide. Given that dismantling the eurozone would mean the end of the French establishment?s European project and would weaken Europe?s ability to advance its interests vis-?-vis global powers like the United States and China, ?monetary anti-union? is unthinkable.
France?s global ambition is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro. For example, in 2011, Edmond Alphand?ry, a former economy minister, declared that a eurozone exit by a member country was as likely as a dollar exit by Texas or California. Here, on full display, was the wishful thinking that brought the euro into existence in the first place: its French architects dreamed of a Europe that could equal the US. That was always an illusory ambition, but it continues to cloud European leaders? judgment.
The single currency?s advocates are right about one thing: political motives have always underpinned the establishment of monetary unions, from Latin America?s in the period from 1865 to 1927 to that between Ireland and Britain from 1922 to 1979. But they are missing a crucial point: politics is also the reason for these unions? dissolution. When the economic costs and divergences become too much of a threat, the political will to do what it takes to ensure the common currency?s survival collapses.
Voter reaction against the euro may well force the eurozone to stop lying still and take real action. The question is whether that would mean that some or all eurozone countries must go their separate ways.

Omega's Cooperman says eBay should spin off portion of PayPal: CNBC,"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-funds-hedge-cooperman-20140310,0,676164.story",Chicago Tribune,"Omega's Cooperman: eBay should spin off portion of PayPal
March 10, 2014|Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Cooperman, chief executive of hedge fund Omega Advisors, said Monday that he agreed with activist investor Carl Icahn's push for eBay Inc to spin off its PayPal online payments business.
""I give Carl a lot of credit for taking the time and showing the energy, and in this case, we happen to agree with him,"" Cooperman, an eBay shareholder, said on CNBC television. ""I think they should spin out a portion of PayPal,"" he said, noting that he owns about 2 percent of eBay shares.
Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off PayPal. The billionaire investor has repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.
Cooperman also said that the U.S. stock market was fairly valued at its current levels and would be surprised if it shot higher.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 29.6 percent last year, notching its best annual performance since 1997. The benchmark index has risen about 1.6 percent so far this year.
In a separate interview, Icahn told CNBC that eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe has delivered ""mediocre"" results for the company versus peers such as Amazon, Visa and MasterCard Inc.
EBay rejected Icahn's two nominees to its board on Monday, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.
Icahn said Monday that nutrition and weight loss company Herbalife was not a pyramid scheme, a claim that hedge fund manager William Ackman has made. Icahn and Ackman have publicly feuded over the company's value.
Icahn owned about 16.8 percent of Herbalife's shares at the end of last year, according to regulatory filings, while Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management has bet $1.16 billion that the company is a fraud.
""It has gone to a point that I think is almost bordering on the insane,"" Icahn said in response to a New York Times article on Monday about Ackman's $1 billion bet that Herbalife will fail, entitled ""After Big Bet, Hedge Fund Pulls the Levers of Power.""
Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises L.P., said he had ""never sold a share"" of Herbalife.

EBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.
The San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn?s proposed two board nominees.?Icahn, who holds a 2.2 percent stake in eBay, wants the company to spin off PayPal, its electronic payments division. He wanted two of his employees on the eBay board to promote that agenda.
?Neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise,? said Richard Schlosberg, chairman of eBay?s corporate governance and nominating committee.
Instead, eBay backs the re-election of four existing board members: President and CEO John Donahoe; Fred Anderson, co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners; Edward Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent Technologies; and Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.
Talking smack, the company and the pugnacious billionaire issued dueling press releases notable for their frankness.
In a lengthy screed on his website, ShareholdersSquareTable, Icahn accused eBay CEO John Donohoe of ?inexcusable incompetence (that) cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion? for selling Skype too soon and too cheaply. He also attacked eBay board member Marc Andreessen, whose investor group bought Skype and then flipped it to Microsoft at a $4 billion premium. Previously, he?d also taken aim at Intuit?s Cook,
Under eBay?s tender ministrations, PayPal may ?wither,? Icahn wrote. ??I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL ,? he wrote.
For its part, Ebay said Icahn is dabbling in ?false and misleading? statements .
?New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,? it said, referring to Andreessen and Cook. ?And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.??
Icahn?s 2.2 percent eBay stake isn?t actually enough for him to actually wrest much control. So what?s his real agenda?
As Icahn biographer Mark Stevens last week told Chronicle business editor and columnist Tom Lee :??It?s all a game to him. He?s a master chess player. The only person who knows what Carl Icahn really wants is Carl?Icahn.?

More to come...
Here's the letter:
CARL ICAHN ON EBAY:
""WE BELIEVE BASED ON EVIDENCE WE HAVE NEWLY UNCOVERED THAT DONAHOE'S INEXCUSABLE INCOMPETENCE COST EBAY STOCKHOLDERS OVER $4 BILLION. READ OUR LATEST LETTER AND YOU BE THE JUDGE.""
New York, New York, March 10, 2014 - Today Carl C. Icahn released the following open letter to stockholders of eBay Inc.:
We believe, based on our review of the evidence currently available in the public domain, including eBay's own statements, that the following assertions are indisputable. Stockholders: you be the judge.
? eBay CEO John Donahoe oversaw a premature sale of Skype at a diminished price that resulted in eBay stockholders losing over $4 billion as compared to the sale of Skype to Microsoft 18 months later.
? Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners? But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards. If middle management makes a costly error, they pay the price; if the CEO makes one, too often the ""old boy"" board covers it up and gives him a bonus.
? In 2009, Donahoe decided to sell Skype in, according to eBay, ""a competitive process with multiple bidders including several financial and strategic buyers."" [1] We are not sure whether there actually were ""multiple bidders"" as eBay originally stated or whether eBay merely ""contact[ed] multiple financial and strategic buyers"" [2] as they now claim. Regardless, Microsoft clearly was interested in buying Skype but ""walked away"" because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Skype's founders.
? In litigation documents [3] that we have just uncovered, Skype's founders alleged that John Donahoe and eBay director Marc Andreessen's investor group received information from Mike Volpi, an associate of Skype's founders, that there could be a workaround of the technology that was the subject of the licensing dispute between eBay and Skype's founders and that was reportedly the cause of Microsoft ""walking away.""
? With the apparent benefit of this information, Andreessen's investor group purchased a controlling interest in Skype from eBay for $1.9 billion. The Andreessen investor group then quickly settled the licensing litigation with Skype's founders, and flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion - tripling their money in only 18 months. The obvious unanswered question is: why didn't Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype's founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?
? To make matters even more embarrassing for Donahoe, Marc Andreessen boasted upon the announcement of the sale to Microsoft that his group's risks in buying Skype had always been less than they had appeared. He said that he ""knew that for Microsoft and a number of other companies Skype would be an obvious thing to buy"" and that he ""[would] always have the fall-back of selling to strategic buyers."" [4] Obviously, the same logic should also have applied to Donahoe. Therefore, why did he sell Skype to the Andreessen investor group instead of keeping the $4 billion for stockholders (it would have been interesting to see Donahoe's face when Andreessen actually boasted about his windfall)? The board and Donahoe, in typical PR speech, have swept this $4 billion fiasco under the rug and have actually boasted about their success in executing this transaction between eBay and the Andreessen investor group. However, Joe Nocera of the New York Times does not appear to have been fooled by eBay's PR machine. At the time of the sale to Andreessen's group, he wrote: ""And so, the mystery of the Skype deal: why were the winning bidders willing to pay so high a price for a company whose very existence could be threatened by this lawsuit? One possibility is that they have nerves of steel. The other is that they know something nobody else does."" [5]
? Amazingly, Donahoe chose to sell a controlling interest in Skype to Andreessen's investor group, allowing them to reap billions at the expense of eBay and its stockholders, rather than cleaning up the licensing issues and then pursuing a more lucrative exit, such as an IPO or a sale to a strategic buyer.
? Any first year student in finance would understand that if you want to sell a company and you have a party that wishes to buy but is concerned about technology licensing issues, you fix the issues and then you sell. It's even more absurd not to do so when you know there is a potential solution. I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion.
? I have been so successful with companies over the years because I have brought in the right CEO. Sometimes convincing boards to make changes takes years, but when change ultimately comes the results are often startlingly good. In just the last year, simply examine our successes at Forest Laboratories and Chesapeake Energy etc. We believe that at the very least, eBay stockholders must send Donahoe and the board a message that we are very unhappy with the current situation at eBay. In addition to the egregious issues surrounding the Skype situation, it should also be noted that in just the past year eBay has underperformed its peers. Indeed, from January 1, 2013 through our initial involvement on January 10, 2014, Amazon, Visa and MasterCard returned 60%, 48% and 73%, respectively, while eBay stock returned only 2%.
? In our opinion, eBay and PayPal should immediately be separated. It is my firm belief that if this occurred, there would be a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal. However, on the other hand, I fear that if left under the management of eBay it will ""wither"" (as Elon Musk said). I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL - the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola's board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies - ultimately resulting in a sale to Google.
? Sadly in our opinion and the opinion of others eBay does not have years to wait. PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google, Apple, Visa, etc. To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted - management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.
CONCLUSION
The true owners of eBay cannot and should not tolerate any longer the behavior exhibited by CEO John Donahoe and the board as detailed above. We believe that eBay is the quintessential example of what is wrong with corporate governance at many of our public corporations and why the system is dysfunctional. If we, as stockholders, do not send a clear message to the eBay board that we will no longer tolerate the internecine relationships that have come to be accepted as commonplace at eBay, and perhaps more importantly, if we continue to follow the advice of Donahoe, even in light of the transgressions regarding Skype as well as the other failures outlined above, and allow him to continue to lead both eBay and PayPal, and if PayPal fails (as Elon Musk and others far more knowledgeable than me have warned), then investors that own shares in the institutions and funds that control the voting of eBay stock will have every right to cast the blame on everyone who failed to vote for change at eBay.
THE TIME HAS COME TO SEND THE EBAY BOARD A MESSAGE THAT THERE WILL NO LONGER BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT EBAY! VOTE FOR OUR PRECATORY PROPOSAL AND FOR OUR DIRECTOR NOMINEES.
Sincerely,
"
Ebay to Shareholders: Vote Against Icahn Nominees,http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/03/10/ebay-asks-shareholders-to-vote-against-icahn-board-nominees/,Fox Business,"Print
Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has been pitted against Michael Dell in a battle over the future of the PC maker.                                                                   (REUTERS)
Carl Icahn sunk his teeth deeper into eBay ( EBAY ) Monday, claiming to have evidence showing CEO John Donahoe?s ?incompetence? cost shareholders $4 billion.

This comes as the eBay board rejected Icahn?s two board nominees, employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, saying both were unqualified and urging shareholders to vote against them at its upcoming annual meeting.
eBay founder and chairman, Pierre Omidyar, urged company stockholders to support the company?s nominees, a list that includes Donahoe.
Icahn, the billionaire investor who upped his stake recently in eBay, says he has uncovered ?indisputable? evidence related to Donahoe?s handling of eBay?s 2009 Skype deal, which has been of much debate between the two parties in this escalating spat.
The online marketplace sold the Internet telephone and video service to an investor group that included director Marc Andreessen?s venture capital firm in a move that valued it at $2.75 billion. Just years later, Skype was sold to Microsoft ( MSFT ) for $8.5 billion.
?We believe based on evidence we have newly uncovered that Donahoe?s inexcusable incompetence cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,? Icahn said.

He says Donahoe oversaw a ?premature? sale of Skype at a diminished price by selling a controlling interest to Andreessen rather than resolving outstanding litigation between eBay and Skype?s founders, which apparently caused Microsoft to initially walk away from the deal in 2009.
Andreessen, Icahn claims, then resolved the outstanding licensing litigation and flipped Skype to Microsoft for nearly triple the price -- a roughly $4 billion spread Icahn claims should have been paid to eBay?s shareholders.
?The obvious unanswered question is: why didn?t Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype?s founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?? Icahn said.
The investor once again urged eBay shareholders to reconsider Donahoe as CEO, or ?at the very least? send a message that they are ?very unhappy? with the current situation at eBay. He also continued to call for an immediate PayPal spinoff, saying he believes there would be a ?number of bidders? willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal.
In response to Icahn?s criticisms, Donahoe said eBay got the ?highest value at the time? for Skype and that Andreessen recused himself throughout the Skype process despite Icahn?s criticisms that there were conflicts of interest that led to a mishandling of the deal.
On Friday, Andreessen issued a public letter calling out Icahn for his own conflicts of interests related to his unrelated investment in XO and purchase of the telecom giant?s wired business.
?Carl Icahn 2014 would take a dim view of the business ethics of Carl Icahn 2005,? Andreessen wrote in the letter.
Shares of eBay fell more than 1.5% to $58.14 in recent trade. They are up about 9.5% over the last 12 months.

EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn's two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.
Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.
The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.
The chairman of eBay's corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because ""neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.""
EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay's guidelines on ""overboarding.""
EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company's slate, which includes Chief Executive John Donahoe.
The company also said Donahoe's 2013 compensation fell by more than half to $13.8 million. That largely reflects the board's decision in 2012 to give him a one-time award of $14.8 million in performance share units, although eBay's weaker-than-expected financial performance also hurt his pay.
The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.
Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.
The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.
In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of ""inexcusable incompetence"" and said the fast-growing PayPal could ""wither"" if it remains part of eBay.
""PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,"" Icahn said.
EBay called Icahn's comments ""false and misleading.""
""In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,"" eBay said.
EBay shares fell 1.4 percent to $58.22 on the Nasdaq.

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) ? After taking the weekend off to recuperate, both Carl Icahn and eBay Inc. put their gloves back on Monday and got personal by trading more punches in the ongoing public slugfest between the activist investor and the online retailing giant.
Bloomberg News
Carl Icahn
Before the market opened, eBay EBAY, -0.30% ?filed a preliminary proxy statement calling upon its shareholders to reject Icahn?s two nominees for the e-commerce company?s board of directors at eBay?s next annual meeting. Ichan has nominated Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, to eBay?s board, as part of his efforts to get eBay to spin off its PayPal e-payments business as a separate company.
EBay also urged shareholders to vote for the current directors that are up for re-election: Fred Anderson, Edward Barnholt, Scott Cook and company Chief Executive John Donahoe.
And it was Donahoe, in particular, who was in Icahn?s sights on Monday.
In the latest of his colorful open letters to eBay shareholders , Icahn claimed that the ?inexcusable incompetence? of Donahoe has cost eBay?s stock owners more than $4 billion, and based his views on Donahoe?s overseeing of the company?s sale of Skype to a private-equity consortium in 2009.
?Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners?? Icahn said. ?But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards.?
EBay shares fell 1.4%, to close Monday at $58.22.
While eBay was in the red, Facebook Inc. FB, +1.47% ?rose more than 3%, to $72.03. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan raised his price target on the social-networking giant to $90 a share from $72. In a research note, Sheridan said that Facebook?s shares are a ?snowball? that is picking up speed, in part from new advertising deals that are helping the company gain more traction with brands.
Apple Inc. AAPL, +2.04% ?ended the day with a gain of 48 cents a share to close at $530.92 after the company released iOS 7.1 , the latest upgrade to its operating systems the iPhone and iPad. The newest version of iOS 7 comes with Apple?s new CarPlay technology that integrates iOS content with compatible automobiles.
Among other leading tech stocks, decliners were in the majority, as sector leaders such as IBM Corp. IBM, -0.90% Netflix Inc. NFLX, +2.07% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +2.51% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.39% ?and Google Inc.? GOOG, +0.73% ?retreated.
The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.73% ?managed to erase almost all of its early losses and dow by 1.7 points at 4,334 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, +0.98% ?also ended the day in the red.

Carl Icahn
For the last several weeks, a firestorm has been raging between eBay and activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been blasting the company's CEO and its board members, particularly the famed Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen.
In his letters, Icahn has also been making two demands: That PayPal spin-off from eBay and that two of his employees join the company's board.
Not only has CEO John Donahoe staunchly insisted that the two company's will not split, but today eBay rejected both of Icahn's board member nominees in its preliminary proxy statement for its annual meeting.
eBay's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommended Scott Cook to serve as a board member again. In his letters , Icahn had insisted multiple times that Cook, co-founder of Intuit, shouldn't be on the board, because Intuit is a long-term competitor of PayPal.
eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.
In his latest letter to the eBay's board this morning , Icahn writes that Donahoe has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his incompetence.
eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a ""false and misleading"" attack:
John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008. In the five years since John's first analyst day, eBay's stock price has increased more than 460%, significantly outpacing both the Nasdaq and the overall market. John's track record of success at eBay, driving the company's turnaround and growth, is well documented. Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts.
Disclosure: Marc Andreessen is an investor in Business Insider.

EBay plans to ask its shareholders to reject a slate of board nominees proposed by shareholder activist Carl Icahn , raising the stakes in the billionaire's public battle over the online auction giant's corporate governance.
Last month, Icahn nominated two of his employees to eBay's board, which he has accused of putting its interests ahead of the company. On Monday, eBay released a preliminary proxy statement urging shareholders to reject Icahn's nominees.

In a new salvo , Icahn said that CEO John Donahoe, by selling Skype prematurely, had cost shareholders more than $4 billion. Icahn insists that eBay spin off its lucrative PayPal platform?an idea dismissed the company has dismissed.
""PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google , Apple , Visa , etc,"" the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.
""To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal.

In another open letter to eBay stockholders , activist investor Carl Icahn has blasted the company's CEO for actions that he believes have cost the e-commerce giant $4bn (?2.4bn).
Icahn alleges that John Donahoe cost eBay $4bn when he sold Skype in 2009, in what he called a ""premature sale"" at a ""diminished price.""

Icahn Claims Inexcusable Incompetence of eBay CEO Cost Stockholders $4 Billion,http://wallstreetpit.com/102929-icahn-claims-inexcusable-incompetence-of-ebay-ceo-cost-stockholders-4-billion/,Wall Street Pit,"Home Business Icahn Claims Inexcusable Incompetence of eBay CEO Cost Stockholders $4 Billion
Icahn Claims Inexcusable Incompetence of eBay CEO Cost Stockholders $4 Billion
March 10, 2014 Ron Haruni
In the latest episode of the ongoing feud between eBay (EBAY) and billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, CNBC reports that the online auction giant will reject a slate of board nominees proposed by Icahn, raising the stakes in the activist investor?s public battle over ebay?s corporate governance.
Last month, Icahn, who has a 2.15 percent stake in eBay, nominated two of his employees to eBay?s board, which he has accused in recent days of putting its interests ahead of the company. This in reference to the company?s 2009 sale of a majority stake in Skype to an investor group that included Marc Andreessen?s venture capital firm. Icahn has accused Andreessen, who is an eBay board member, of a conflict of interest over the deal. Yet on Monday, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC that ?eBay plans to reject Icahn?s directors.?
In a new development, Icahn, who has demanded an inspection of eBay?s records on the acquisition of Skype in 2005, said that John Donahoe?s ?inexcusable incompetence? had cost stockholders more than $4 billion since he sold the online phone service prematurely.
?We believe based on evidence we have newly uncovered that Donahoe?s inexcusable incompetence cost eBAY?over $4 billion?I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,? the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.
Icahn insists that eBay spin off its fast-growing PayPal payments business ? an idea dismissed by the company.
?PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Visa (V), etc?, said Icahn, adding that ?[t]o win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted ? management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.?
Shares of eBay were down 56 cents, or 0.95%, at $58.50 in pre-market trading Monday.

"UPDATE 1-EBay rejects Icahn board nominees, asks investors to do same",http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/ebay-icahn-idINL2N0M70SN20140310,Reuters,"Cyclical Consumer Goods | Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 7:24pm IST
UPDATE 1-EBay rejects Icahn board nominees, asks investors to do same
By Phil Wahba
March 10 EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn's two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.
Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.
The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP  employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.
The chairman of eBay's corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because ""neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.""
EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay's guidelines on ""overboarding.""
EBay founder and chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company's slate, which includes chief executive John Donahoe.
The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.
Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.
The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.
In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of ""inexcusable incompetence"" and said the fast-growing PayPal could ""wither"" if it remains part of eBay.
""PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,"" Icahn said.
EBay called Icahn's comments ""false and misleading.""
""In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,"" eBay said.
EBay shares were down 0.9 percent to $58.51 in early trading.

Carl Icahn: Donahoe Cost eBay Investors More Than $4B,http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/carl-icahn-donahoe-cost-ebay-investors-more-than-4b/,ValueWalk,"Share Tweet Post Flip
Carl Icahn has again posted an open letter on his website, Shareholders? Square Table , about eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the ongoing conflicts of interest he sees with the company?s board members. He said he has uncovered new evidence which he says makes his assertion that shareholders lost billions on the Skype deal indisputable.
Carl Icahn image via FBN
Skype sale resulted in eBay shareholders losing
The activist investor blames CEO John Donahoe for overseeing ?a premature sale of Skype at a diminsted price,? which he says resulted in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders losing more than $4 billion compared with how much Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid for the VoIP service provider. Icahn believes Donahoe would be fired if eBay was a private company and the ?facts? about this were disclosed.
Donahoe decided in 2009 to sell Skype after receiving offers from ?multiple bidders.? Icahn isn?t sure whether there were ?multiple bidders,? which eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) originally said or whether the company contacted a number of buyers, which the auction site now claims. The activist investor believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was ?clearly interested in buying Skype but ?walked away? because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Sky?e founders.?
Icahn uncovers new documents
Icahn said they discovered new litigation documents in which Donahoe and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) board member Marc Andreessen learned about a workaround of the licensed technology which caused Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to walk away. He states that Andreessen bought a controlling interest in Skype at that point for $1.9 billion, then settled the licensing litigation and ?flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion?tripling their money in only 18 months.? The activist investor questions why Donahoe didn?t settle the issue and then just sell Skype directly to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).
He then made the case for why PayPal should be separated from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), suggesting that there would be ?a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal? and that if the payment services provider is left under eBay?s management, then it could ?wither,? like BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) (TSE:BB), Dell, Nintendo and other technology companies.
eBay launches its own website
Donahoe has maintained that they should keep PayPal as a subsidiary, and his company launched a website? bettertogether.ebayinc.com ?which puts forth his case for why the two companies should remain together. On the site, the company states that PayPal has grown faster with the auction site and that it generates about 30% of PayPal?s new users. The company also states that the auction site speeds up PayPal?s success and makes it ?smarter.? In addition, it states that it funds the services provider?s growth.

McDonald's Corporation (MCD) February Sales Results Decline,http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/mcdonalds-corporation-mcd-february-sales-results-decline/,ValueWalk,"Share Tweet Post Flip
The same-store sales results of McDonald?s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) declined 0.3% in February as the company experienced weakness in the United States and Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA).
According to the largest fast food chain operator, the sales performance of its segments in the United States and APMEA dropped 1.4% and 2.6% respectively while its segment in Europe rose 0.6%.
McDonald?s?Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is experiencing challenges trying to increase its sales performance , particularly in the United States. Last January, the sales performance of the company?s U.S. fell 3.3%. CEO Don Thompson previously stated that McDonald?s needs to improve its menu offerings as it became less relevant to some customers.
McDonald?s growth priorities
Today, Thompson reiterated that the growth priorities of?McDonald?s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) globally include optimizing menus, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening the accessibility to McDonald?s brands. According to him, these priorities are the foundation of the company?s customer-centric approach in building its business over the long-term.
?We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald?s each day,? added Thompson.
Severe weather conditions
McDonald?s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) explained that its U.S. sales was impacted by challenging industry dynamics and severe weather conditions last month. In APMEA, its sales were affected by weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.
On the other hand, the largest food chain operator said its positive sale performance in Europe was due to the continued strong sales in the United Kingdom and France, which offset the ongoing weakness in Germany.?McDonald?s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its European segment is benefiting from its local menu options, expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours.
Peter Bensen, chief financial officer at McDonald?s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its relatively flat global comparable sales year-to-date will pressure margins in the first quarter. He emphasized that the company is ?diligently strengthening? its performance, and he is confident that the management is taking the right actions to clearly align with customer?s needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitability.

In another sign of continued pressures facing the fast-food industry, McDonald?s Corp. on Monday reported disappointing monthly same-store U.S. sales, its fourth-straight month of declines despite its aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games where it plugged products like its $5?20-piece chicken nuggets.

/quotes/zigman/245476/delayed /quotes/nls/wmt WMT also has hurt restaurant chains like McDonald?s, analysts said.? The company also has faced increased competition from fast-casual chains including Chipotle
/quotes/zigman/395806/delayed /quotes/nls/cmg CMG and Panera
/quotes/zigman/65095/delayed /quotes/nls/pnra PNRA . More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald?s struggling to make itself relevant for today?s consumers.
According to the? National Restaurant Association?s ?2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year?s level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.
?The U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald?s hasn?t kept up,? Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.
A case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain Sbarro on Monday? filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.
To reverse waning demand, McDonald?s recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson? also is ?enhancing the breakfast experience? at the chain to create ?more of a coffee culture.? After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory. It also will be offering a new Bacon Clubhouse sandwich featuring Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The company is also testing giving consumers the ability to customize their orders, taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.
U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters. Overseas, European comparable sales were up 0.6%, while sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, as well as a stronger dollar, which made its food more expensive abroad.
Without the weight of a stronger dollar, total world-wide sales would have risen 2.2% , instead of a 0.6% decline in February, the company said.
Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald?s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.
?We believe the current more challenging reality is reflected in valuation,? said Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein, who rates the stock overweight. ?While not the strongest near-term performer, we expect
MCD to regain lost U.S. share in ?14, and benefit from a European macro recovery.?
McDonald?s shares dipped 0.4% to $95.11 Monday morning. They are down 3.6% during the past year, the third-worst Dow performer. In comparison, Chipotle jumped 82%, while Panera is up 11%, during the same period.

UPDATE 2-McDonald's U.S. sales continue to struggle in February
By Phil Wahba
March 10 McDonald's Corp on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States.
The world's biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3  percent last month. That was below analysts' average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.
U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast.
McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year ""will pressure margins"" in the first quarter.
McDonald's has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service.
That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald's since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year.
Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year.
Thompson said in a statement that McDonald's is ""intent on improving our business performance."" McDonald's said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes.
McDonald's is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp  debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands'  Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos.
McDonald's again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald's less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages.
In Europe, the company's biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region.
Analysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia.
McDonald's shares were down 0.4 percent Monday morning.

McDonald's reported sales at stores open at least 13 months fell in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather. The fast-food chain has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods. (Star-Ledger file photo)
comments
McDonald?s, the world?s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather.
Analysts estimated a 0.1 percent decline, the average of 15 projections from Consensus Metrix. Domestic same-store sales slid 1.4 percent, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald?s said in a statement today, while analysts anticipated a drop of 0.6 percent in the U.S.
McDonald?s, which has more than 14,200 U.S. locations, has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods. The fast-food industry also is struggling with shaky consumer confidence and a severe winter that McDonald?s says hurt its U.S. sales last month.
?Weather was definitely an impact in the month of February -- that?s going to be a drag on everybody,? Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. Also, rival fast-food chains are introducing new items, improving stores and drawing U.S. diners away from McDonald?s, he said.
?The other players from Wendy?s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they?re taking back some share,? he said.
The shares fell 0.3 percent to $95.20 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. McDonald?s slumped 1.6 percent this year through March 7, the most recent full trading day, while the Standard & Poor?s 500 Restaurants Index declined 1.7 percent.
Pressuring Margins
Little-changed global comparable-store sales so far this year will pressure margins in the first quarter, McDonald?s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said in the statement.
While U.S. consumer sentiment rose in February after declining in January, the economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than was previously estimated. Smaller gains in consumer spending, inventories and exports are weighing on the economy and indicate less momentum heading into 2014.
McDonald?s, along with other chains, is trying to draw diners and boost revenue in the morning. While it pushes new McCafe beverages and $1 coffees, Starbucks Corp. is revamping its breakfast sandwiches, and Yum! Brands?s Taco Bell is rolling out breakfast foods, such as sausage burritos and waffle tacos, to its U.S. stores this month. Burger King Worldwide Inc. also has said it?s focused on improving and advertising its morning menu.
European Sales
Same-store sales rose 0.6 percent in Europe and fell 2.6 percent in the company?s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Analysts estimated drops of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, which is owned by Kaul Advisory Group in Wayne. Same-store sales declined 8.7 percent in Japan last month.
In February, breakfast foods and extended hours contributed to a ?strong performance? in the U.K. and positive same-store sales in France, McDonald?s said.
Comparable-store sales are considered an indicator of a retailer?s performance because they include only older, established locations. McDonald?s has about 35,400 restaurants worldwide and 81 percent of those are franchised.
McDonald?s is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 22.

OAK BROOK, Ill., March 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- McDonald's Corporation today announced that global comparable sales decreased 0.3%in February.? Performance by segment was as follows:
""McDonald's global growth priorities - optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to Brand McDonald's - are the foundation of our customer-centric approach to building our business for the long term,"" said McDonald's President and Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson.? ""We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald's each day.""
In February, U.S. comparable sales decreased 1.4% amid challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.? Across the segment, McDonald's priority remains building guest traffic through improved restaurant operations and customer service, relevant menu news, and strong consistent value offerings to regain momentum.
Europe's comparable sales rose 0.6% in February as a result of continued strong performance in the U.K. and positive results in France largely?offset by ongoing weakness in Germany.? Local menu options and expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours continue to support the segment's performance.
In APMEA, February comparable sales decreased 2.6% primarily due to weakness in Japan and, to a lesser extent, a shift in?timing of Chinese New Year and negative results in Australia.? To strengthen performance, APMEA is pursuing customer-focused initiatives to deliver menu variety, increased convenience and branded affordability across the segment.
""We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter,"" said McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen.? ""Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth.""
Systemwide sales for the month decreased 0.6%, or increased 2.2% in constant currencies.

Definitions
Comparable sales represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. Management reviews the increase or decrease in comparable sales compared with the same period in the prior year to assess business trends.
The number of weekdays and weekend days can impact our reported comparable sales. For the month of February 2014, there was no calendar shift/trading day adjustment as the month included exactly 28 trading days, or four complete weeks, during 2014 and 2013.? In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales.
Information in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends.
Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
Upcoming Communications
Pete Bensen, Chief Financial Officer, will speak at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer and Retail Conference at 8:50 a.m. (Eastern Time) in New York on March 11, 2014, and at the RBC Capital Markets' Consumer and Retail Conference at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) in Boston on March 12, 2014.? These presentations will be webcast live and available for replay for a limited time thereafter at www.investor.mcdonalds.com .
McDonald's tentatively plans to release first quarter results before the market opens on April 22, 2014 and will host an investor webcast.? This webcast will be broadcast live and available for replay for a limited time thereafter at www.investor.mcdonalds.com .
About McDonald's
McDonald's is the world's leading global foodservice retailer with over 35,000 locations serving approximately 70 million customers in over 100 countries each day.? More than 80% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business men and women.

Next big move by stocks is likely down: Deutsche Bank's Bianco
by William Watts
Add a Comment
The S&P 500 has already cruised past Deutsche Bank?s year-end forecast of 1,850 and may have further to go, writes top strategist David Bianco in a Monday note. But the firm now expects the next 5%-plus move by stocks to be down, he says.
In part, that?s because Deutsche Bank is worried by high price-to-earnings ratio, a continuing trend of earnings forecast downgrades and a lack of ?higher quality? drivers for earnings per share and the price/equity ratio. Bianco would prefer to see EPS and P/E driven by increased capital expenditure and export growth as opposed to share buybacks. Read more here .

Brad McMillan: 'Margin debt is high, but ...'
by Anora Mahmudova
Add a Comment
The bull market?s fifth anniversary prompted many strategist reassess market conditions and valuations.
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial, in a research note, writes that margin debt is in elevated territory and?and the conditions may be appropriate for a correction.
Margin debt is important for several reasons. First, available and cheap financing allows investors to buy more, which, in a virtuous circle, can lead to more demand and higher prices. If, however, prices start to decline, the debt still has to be repaid. So investors sell to raise cash, which pushes prices down, and so on. Debt raises the possibility of a downward spiral, and can make a spiral more severe when it happens.
The other reason margin debt is important is it reflects investors? attitude toward risk. By taking on more debt, investors are showing they expect stocks to rise and do not believe risks are that high?which lasts until the market turns. Just as with debt, the change in sentiment can drive prices down even faster than they rose.
I will write next week about indicators that can actually show when to worry about the market in the short term, but the level of margin debt is not one of them. It is, however, an indicator you should keep an eye on in the medium and longer term.

Five years after recession
comments
What a difference five years makes.
Five years ago Sunday, the stock market indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting?6,547.10?on March 9, 2009?-- less than half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&P 500, meanwhile, dipped to?676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007, when it had soared to 1,565.15.
*? Download the above chart in full-size
Today, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&P is at more than 1,875.
Many of our local companies have enjoyed a similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have soared and dividends have increased in many cases.
The chart below looks at the total five-year return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and workers. The total?return includes appreciation in the share price and income including dividends.?
So if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $28,380.?
If you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M. Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about $3,000 today.
In some cases, the fabulous returns are a reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008 and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has done since then.
Likewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years.?
In other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence, the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19 percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded.?
In the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in 2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.
The five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.

World stocks, copper, oil decline after weak China export data
China?s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly 9 months; Wall Street falls

New York: Global stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world?s second-largest economy.
China?s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1% from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China?s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.
The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday?s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.
China?s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve?s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.
?The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,? said Jeffrey Young , interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.
Prices on benchmark 10-year US treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78%.
The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.
In the US stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.96 points or 0.5%, to 16,369.76, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points or 0.34%, to 1,871.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.561 points or 0.38%, to 4,319.662. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.
Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.2% to $31.16 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6%.
European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5%, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China?s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.5% and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3%.
German steel maker ThyssenKrupp , down 3%, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world?s top commodity buyer.
?Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,? said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.
Adding to the day?s concerns, in Crimea unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post, in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.
Russia said the US had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.
On Wall Street, Boeing Co. shares lost 2.3% to $125.62 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that ?hairline cracks? had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company?s newest jet.
Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an ?unprecedented aviation mystery,? a senior official said on Monday.
Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.7% at $23. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company?s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws , vice-president, global communications and investor relations.
Chinese Data Weighs On Australian, Canadian Dollars
The Aussie traded 0.4% lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2% at $1.1104.
?The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning?you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,? said Alvin Tann , strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.
The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China?s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.
The US dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that the US job growth would pick up in the wake of last week?s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.75.
In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since 25 June and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.
Adding to the pressure was China?s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30% in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27% from last year?s levels.
The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 79 cents lower at $108.23. The US oil fell $1.25 to $101.33 a barrel. Reuters
Marc Jones in London and Sam Forgione and Richard Leong in New York also contributed to this story.

"US stocks dip on weak Asian data, Ukraine",http://www.brecorder.com/markets/equity/americas/161668-us-stocks-dip-on-weak-asian-data-ukraine.html,Business Recorder,"NEW YORK: US stocks Monday fell in early trade following disappointing economic data from China and Japan and continued tension over Ukraine.
About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.92 (0.29 percent) to 16,404.80.
The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 2.09 (0.11 percent) to 1,875.95, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.37 (0.01 percent) lower to 4,335.85.
Weekend economic data from China raised questions about the outlook for the world's second largest economy.
Beijing reported weak inflation data and a $23.0 billion trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $11.9 billion surplus.
Meanwhile Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 percent, than the previously reported 0.3 percent.
Investors are also skittish over tensions between Russia and the West after Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Crimea had the right to join his country.
McDonald's became the latest big company to cite cold weather as a factor in diminished sales, saying frigid temperatures in the US were a factor in a 1.4 percent drop in comparable restaurant sales in February. Shares of the Dow component dipped 0.4 percent.
Boeing fell 1.9 percent after Japan Airlines Sunday said its Dreamliner jet made an emergency landing in Honolulu reportedly due to a possible problem with its hydraulic system.
The news followed a Friday Boeing disclosure that hairline cracks were found in the wings of some of its 787 Dreamliners that are still in production, due to a manufacturing problem.
Chiquita Brands International announced it was combining with Irish company Fyffes into a global produce distributor with a combined equity value of about $1.1 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the new company. Chiquita jumped 12.6 percent.
Bond prices were mixed. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury held steady at 2.79 percent, the same level as Friday, while the 30-year edged higher to 3.73 percent from 3.72 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.

With little U.S. economic or corporate news on the docket Monday, investors kept an eye on the rest of the world to get a sense of where the market is headed.
The Dow trimmed a loss of over 100 points earlier in the day, but still ended slightly in the red. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq finished flat.
The Dow and S&P 500 are near all-time highs as investors celebrated the five year anniversary of the current bull market.
But the Nasdaq is not back to all-time highs yet.
In fact, Monday is the 14-year anniversary of the tech-heavy index hitting its peak of above 5,130.
Still, the Nasdaq is now only about 15.5% below its dot-com boom record, thanks to a nearly 40% jump last year and strong start to 2014.
Nasdaq 5000 again? It may happen!
European markets closed mostly in the red. And Asian markets ended significantly lower after China trade data and revised Japanese GDP numbers came in weaker than expected.
Boeing ( BA ) shares fell after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777, disappeared Saturday in mysterious circumstances en route to Beijing. The company also announced late Friday that ""hairline cracks"" had been found on some of its Dreamliner 787 jets still in production.

But one trader on StockTwits thought the stock's dip might be short-lived.
"" $BA I wonder if BA jumps right back up after all this bad news,"" said bluegill1972 . ""I'm thinking this might be a buy soon.""
Tension in Ukraine created volatility in global markets early last week. But investors have been breathing a sigh of relief the past few days as the crisis seems to be abating.
""As long as there's no feeling that an escalation into a wider conflict is imminent, the markets may remain calm,"" said Wasif Latif of USAA Investments in a note to clients Monday morning.

In other corporate news, Chiquita Brands ( CQB ) rallied more than 10% after the company said it was buying Ireland's Fyffes for about $526 million to create the world's leading banana company.
Shares of 3-D printer maker DDD Systems ( DDD ) plunged 5% after a report over the weekend claimed that investors may be overpaying for 3-D printing stocks. The stock is down around 30% this year after a huge run in 2013.
But StockTwits user johnnyquest felt that the report was ""shortsighted"" and that 3-D printing technology will continue to grow. "" $DDD The law of accelerating returns will prevail in 3d printing. We'll be printing our wardrobes soon,"" he said.
LowRiskTrader echoed that sentiment. ""$DDD ...Every sell off is a reason to buy,"" he said.

Shares of eBay ( EBAY ), a member of CNNMoney's Tech 30 Index, slumped after Carl Icahn stepped up his campaign against the company's management.
In a letter Monday, the activist investor attacked John Donahue, the company's CEO, for failing to supervise his firm's board for alleged conflicts of interest related to their financial stakes in companies that Icahn believes are eBay competitors. eBay responded by defending Donahue's record. Icahn wants eBay to spin off its PayPal unit.
"" $EBAY board. When will you guys learn. Mr. Icahn always gets his way,"" quipped tonytan0 on StockTwits.

Stocks Down At Midday On Weak China Export Data,http://news.investors.com/investing-stock-market-today/031014-692648-stocks-down-in-weak-volume.htm,Investor's Business Daily,"Reprints
Stocks continued to pare losses Monday afternoon as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting that starts tomorrow and key economic data later this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were off 0.2%. Volume was down 18% on the Nasdaq and was little changed on the NYSE compared to the same time Friday.
Russian Internet portal Yandex ( YNDX ) took the biggest hit among IBD 50 stocks, sinking 4%. Company co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Ilya Segalovich died Sunday of cancer after slipping into a coma last week. He was 48.
Elsewhere, Chinese Internet portal Sohu.com ( SOHU ) plunged 9% on weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue. Volume was huge as the stock sliced through its 50-day line and fell 8% below a 68.41 buy point of an irregular base. That was enough to trigger a key IBD sell rule for investors who bought at the breakout.
SouFun Holdings ( SFUN ), another Chinese stock, fell 6% after hitting a new high Friday. But it's still extended 22% from a 27.90 buy point.
The real-estate listings website triggered the eight-week hold rule earlier this month after jumping more than 20% above the buy point in less than three weeks. Stocks that rise that much within three weeks of a breakout should be held for at least eight weeks because they're potential big winners.
On the upside, IBD 50 stock Actavis ( ACT ) climbed 1% to a new high in heavy volume, adding to its breakout from a 133.10 buy point. On Friday, the developer of generic and branded drugs said Q2 profit rose 42%, edging above expectations, on a 47% jump in sales. Both figures were the best in five quarters.

Wall Street edges lower after S&P's record close,http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/154063/wall-street-edges-lower-after-sps-record-close,Buenos Aires Herald,"Monday, March 10, 2014
S&P dips after record; China data, Boeing weigh
US stocks dipped today, weighed down by soft data out of China and Boeing's latest production setback.
Merger and acquisition announcements, however, as well as company-specific news including on Facebook and Alexion Pharma, helped keep the S&P 500 and Nasdaq from bigger losses.
China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.04 points or 0.21 percent, to 16,418.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.87 points or 0.05 percent, to 1,877.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.775 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,334.448.
The S&P 500 had closed at a record of 1,878.04 on Friday.
European shares fell for the second straight session today. Most European indexes swung lower in the afternoon after the Interfax news agency reported Russian troops had opened fire with automatic rifles during a takeover of a Ukrainian naval post in Crimea.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.4 percent lower at 1,320.98 points after re-testing a low set last week earlier in the session, in a broad sell-off involving most sectors.
Japanese shares retreated from a five-week high as disappointing Chinese trade data and uncertainty over the crisis in Ukraine prompted investors to lock in recent gains.
The benchmark Nikkei closed down 1 percent at 15,120.14, slipping from a five-week peak hit on Friday, in thin trading volume.

Benchmarks ended Friday's trading session on a mixed note. The S&P 500 and Dow gained modestly on the back of better-than-expected nonfarm payroll data. These marginal gains were strong enough for the S&P 500 to hit another record high for the second consecutive day. Investors were also kept on the edge by recent developments in the Crimea region; leading to a volatile trading session.
For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.2% to close Friday's trading session at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor (S&P 500) edged up 0.1% to finish at 1,878.04. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 4,336.22. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped 0.7% to settle at 14.11. Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 billion shares. Advancing stocks were outnumbered by declining stocks on the NYSE. For 41% stocks that advanced, 56% declined.
For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 1.0% and the Dow posted a gain of 0.8%. The Nasdaq gained for the fifth-straight week and has improved 0.7% since last Friday. The benchmarks managed to remain in the positive territory through the week as tension between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea region subsided. Following these developments, investors have been confident enough to invest in equities rather than traditional safe-haven assets.
The new agreemenmt between The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) has added to the bullish mood. The European Central Bank and the Central Bank of United Kingdom's decisions to not change the key lending rates were welcomed by investors. There were mixed reports on the economic front; which investors overlooked as an outcome of the bitter winter season.
Coming back to Friday's events, US stocks began the day on an upbeat note following a better-than-expected nonfarm payroll report for February. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payroll employment had risen to 175,000 in February from 129,000 in January. The rise came despite the harsh winter weather. The increase was more than the consensus estimate of a jump to 152,000.
This report from the Labor Department pushed the S&P 500 to an intraday record of 1,883.57. However, the benchmarks gave away some of the gains as investors remained apprehensive about the US Federal Reserve's next possible move following better jobs data. The Fed's next ?policy meeting will take place later this month.
The Labor Department also reported that unemployment rate had edged up to 6.7% in February from 6.6% in January. This rise in unemployment rate was the first increase in 14 months and was more than the consensus estimate of it remaining flat at 6.6%.
Meanwhile, consumer credit increased 5.3% or $13.7 billion in January according to the Federal Reserve. However, the increase in the indicator of potential future spending levels was slightly less than the consensus estimate of an increase by $14 billion.
Separately, the Department of Commerce reported a deficit in goods and services of $39.1 billion in January, up from revised $39.0 billion in December. This rise in the country's largest component of balance of payments was also more than the consensus estimate of $37 billion.
Investors also kept an eye on the developments in the Crimea region where a referendum on whether or not to split the region from Ukraine and make it a part of Russia is possibly being prepared. Geo-political concerns surged when Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over movement of Russian troops in the Crimea region.
Five out of ten sectors of the S&P 500 ended in green. Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) led the gains as the sector rose 0.5%. Top holdings from the sector such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) and American Express Company and (NYSE: AXP ) increased 1.3%, 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively.
Among the declining stocks, SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) led the decline as the sector fell 0.5%. Key stocks from the sector such as USG Corporation (NYSE: USG ), DR Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI ), NVR, Inc. (NYSE: NVR ) and Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN ) decreased 2.4%. 1.6%. 0.6% and 1.9%, respectively.

With little U.S. economic or corporate news on the docket Monday, investors were keeping an eye on the rest of the world to get a sense of where the market is headed.
The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were all slightly lower out of the gate.
The Dow and S&P 500 are near all time highs as investors celebrated the five year anniversary of the current bull market. But the Nasdaq is not back to all-time highs yet. In fact, Monday is the 14-year anniversary of the tech-heavy index hitting its peak of above 5,130. Still, the Nasdaq is now only about 15.5% below its dot-com boom record, thanks to a nearly 40% jump last year and strong start to 2014.
Tension in Ukraine created volatility in global markets early last week. But investors have been breathing a sigh of relief the past few days as the crisis seems to be abating.
""As long as there's no feeling that an escalation into a wider conflict is imminent, the markets may remain calm,"" said Wasif Latif of USAA Investments in a note to clients Monday morning. ""
In corporate news, Boeing shares fell after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777, disappeared Saturday in mysterious circumstances en route to Beijing. The company also announced late Friday that ""hairline cracks"" had been found on some of its Dreamliner 787 jets still in production.
Chiquita Brands rallied after the company said it was buying Ireland's Fyffes for about $526 million to create the world's leading banana company.
Shares of eBay, a member of CNNMoney's Tech 30 Index, slumped after Carl Icahn stepped up his campaign against the company's management. In a letter Monday, the activist investor again attacked eBay's board for alleged conflicts of interest related to their financial interests in companies that Icahn believes are eBay competitors. Icahn wants eBay to spin off its PayPal unit.
European markets were mixed in afternoon trading. Asian markets ended significantly lower after China trade data and revised Japanese GDP numbers came in weaker than expected.

New York - US stocks edged modestly lower on Monday, and the S&P 500 held near record highs, as investors largely shrugged off unexpectedly weak data in China.
China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

?We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,? said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York.
?I don't think it's disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome.?
Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.4 percent.
Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P's 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.
?That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?? said Kenny.
In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672.
McDonald's Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.
Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that ?hairline cracks? had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company's newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an ?unprecedented aviation mystery,? a senior official said on Monday.
Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe's largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world's biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42.
United Rentals Inc, gained 3.9 percent to $91.98 after the world's largest equipment rental company said it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.

U.S. equity markets stumbled on Monday after weaker-than-expected export data from China spooked Wall Street traders.
Today's Markets
As of 11:56 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 79.4 points, or 0.48%, to 16373, the S&P 500 slumped 6.5 points, or 0.35%, to 1872 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 14.1 points, or 0.32%, to 4322.
The broad S&P 500 closed at yet another record high last week, climbing 1%. The monthly jobs report, which is considered one of Wall Street's most important gauges, showed the American economy added more jobs than expected last month, helping traders shake off worries that the recent bout of weakness was sparked by more than temporary factors.?
A report on Chinese trade, however, once again sparked concerns about the global economy. The world's No. 2 economy saw its exports plummet 18.1% on year-over-year basis in February, compared to expectations they would rise 7.5%. Japan's fourth-quarter growth was also revised down to an annual rate of 0.7% from 1%.?

Dow Jones Industrial Average: 5 Year Stock Market Crash Anniversary [Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares]
Share Tweet
Tara Clarke: ?The stock market crash this week that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S. stock markets.
Subprime financial crisis-related events would ultimately become responsible for? five out of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes , including the top two spots.
After the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 ? a little under 18 months later.
U.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.
Since that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The?S&P 500?Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the?Dow Jones Industrial Average?has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the?Nasdaq?is up 235% (3,040.5).
In fact, as of this week, the bull market ? defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more ? ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group research.
However, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction ? defined as a decline of 10% or more.
?I am very concerned about a correction right now,??Money Morning?Chief Financial Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. ?The past few weeks have seen higher prices and lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air ? every step higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather and turn around.?
Here are the three signs that have investors worried we?re due for a stock market crash or correction soon?
First, many investors are nervous about the duration of this bull market.
Most last from 50 to 67 months. The bull market that began in 1982 lasted about 60 months before the 1987 stock market crash. The bull market that began in 2002 lasted 60 months to a high in 2007.
And eerily, yesterday (Thursday), our current bull market hit its 60-month anniversary. The past two bull markets were immediately followed by crushing bear markets, and 2009?s fallout was the biggest since the Great Depression.
Second, investors are nervous about the lack of market correction.
A market correction hasn?t happened since October 2011 ? that?s a 29-month stretch.
Historically, corrections occur every 18 months, according to?S&P Capital IQ.
?The longer we go without resetting the dial, the greater the likelihood of a steeper correction, and the greater likelihood that it becomes a bear market,? S&P Capital IQ chief equity strategist Sam Stovall said to?USA Today.
The third and final sign making investors wary of a stock market crash is? U.S. Federal Reserve ?action. Since initiating its? quantitative easing (QE) ?program in 2008, the Fed has managed to plump its balance sheet to somewhere over $4 trillion.
In December 2013, the Fed announced its intent to begin unwinding QE by tapering its monthly bond purchases. Since January, the Fed has cut its bond buying by $10 billion a month (to $75 billion).
That tapering is likely to negatively impact equity markets as fewer U.S. Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities are purchased each month.
Even though investors may give pause to the possibility of a stock market crash or correction, they should nonetheless stay invested ? just with caution.
?You have to be in it to win it. I am urging people to raise stops and play very conservatively right now. But, do stay ready to buy,? Fitz-Gerald said. ?Going forward, look to financials, tech,? healthcare , and defense stocks.?

We?re in the midst of the greatest?investing?boom in almost 60 years. And rest assured ? this boom is not about to end anytime soon.

Recent headlines make you believe that the market has been doing exceptional, and it is had a nice run recently, but let's get real.? The Dow Jones industrial average ( NYSE:DIA ) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 ( NYSE:SPY ) and NASDAQ ( NYSE:QQQ ) handily.? In addition, if current sentiment has anything to do with it, another major peak may be on the horizon.
Smaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time.? My business is one that is constantly monitoring these smaller investors, be it through their responses through social media, traditional media outlets, market based financial articles, television, or through the real time trading reports that we publish for individual stocks, and in keeping my finger on the pulse of these smaller investors I often find contrarian indicators that are actionable from time to time.?
This might be one of those times.
The epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again.? Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.
To anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener.? The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily).? Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.
During that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery.? Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy.? They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind.? On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.? When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.
Given what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business.? The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.

US STOCKS SNAPSHOT-Wall St opens lower after S&P's record close
NEW YORK, March 10 U.S. stocks opened slightly lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&P 500, following unexpectedly weak data from China that tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 44.89 points, or 0.27 percent, at 16,407.83. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 3.14 points, or 0.17 percent, at 1,874.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 5.25 points, or 0.12 percent, at 4,330.97.

Weighing on stocks was a report from China, the world?s second-largest economy, over the weekend that showed its exports unexpectedly skidded 18.1% in February over a year earlier. Economists had expected an increase of 5%. The surprise drop also hit copper prices .
?In the short term, China?s trade data was disappointing, however, at this point it is unclear how much of it was distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday,? said John De Clue, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
?U.S. equities still remain the market of choice for a lot of international money, which is why we have seen more multiple expansion over the past few weeks,? he added.
Among individual stocks, shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc. US:CQB jumped 11% after the company announced an all-stock merger deal with Fyffes PLC UK:FFY ?worth $1.07 billion on Monday.
FMC FMC, +0.38% ?shares climbed 6.2% after the company said Monday it will split into two entities by early next year, with one company consisting of FMC?s agricultural solutions and health and nutrition units and the other will focus on its minerals business.
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. CLF, -1.79% ?shares dropped 3.8% in the wake of weak data out of China.
Boeing Co. BA, -1.32% ?shares fell 1.3% after The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that the company has discovered cracks in some 787 Dreamliner jets , which will lead to a delayed delivery of some aircraft.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ALXN, +2.98% ?shares gained 7.1% after the biopharmaceutical company on Monday raised its 2014 adjusted earnings outlook .
Plug Power Inc. PLUG, +2.68% ?shares jumped 25%, adding to last week?s gains of 77%. Plug Power last week scored a contract with six distribution centers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +0.07% and the price target on its shares was boosted by Cowen & Co. analysts on hope of more contracts.
Facebook Inc. FB, +1.47% ?shares rose 3.2% after UBS raised the stock?s price target to $90 from $72. Analyst Eric Sheridan said Facebook shares are undervalued but is expected to accelerate in value going forward.
In overseas markets, Asian stocks fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -0.24% ?down nearly 3%. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.67% ?lost 1%. European markets fell.
Oil prices fell, with April crude US:CLJ4 ?off more than 1%. Gold prices regained foot and rose.

Dow Jones Transportation Average Pushing Higher,http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dow-jones-transportation-average-pushing-higher-cm333680,NASDAQ,"Dow Jones Transportation Average Pushing Higher
March 10, 2014, 10:02:25 AM EDT By Olson Global Markets

With both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index hovering just below major trend line resistance levels, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) continues to push to new highs and well above former ?channel top? resistance.
Importantly, this upward movement in transportation stocks is very positive for equity prices in general since a key element of Dow Theory suggests that transportation stocks usually lead the industrials to higher levels as economic activity improves.
Although overbought conditions are clearly present on all three indices at the moment, near-term corrections are always possible on each. Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.
That represents a potential 24% advance above current levels. It does not mean, however, that a move up to the 9,500 area is likely to emerge anytime soon, but it does represent an underlying optimism in equities that persists.
At this point in time, geopolitical and weather related issues continue to cloud future expectations for growth. That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.
Still, another facet of Dow Theory suggests that rising equity prices are usually accompanied by rising trading volumes which act as a confirmation to the prevailing bullish trend.
As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.

Dow Jones Industrial Average Gained Last Week,http://www.investing.com/analysis/dow-jones-industrial-average-gained-last-week-205343,Investing.com,"Follow
Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed last week as warning signs flashed?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and the S&P500 (SPY) posted gains for the week as Friday?s employment report exceeded expectations and Ukraine stayed on the back burner.
For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gained 0.8%, the SP500 (SPY) added 1% and the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.7%.
The week was choppy as markets reacted to the situation in Ukraine and also hit new highs.
Economic reports were mostly positive as U.S. PMI registered 57.1 and exceeded expectations and initial jobless claims posted 323,000 versus expectations of 335,000 and last week?s 349,000.
February ISM was also well received at 53.2% compared to expected of 52.5% and last month?s 51.3%.
The big news of the week was the conflict with Russia in Ukraine and Russia?s stock market (RSX) fell approximately 12% for the week.
This coming week brings NFIB small business index on Tuesday, Thursday sees weekly jobless claims, February retail sales, and Friday reveals producer prices and University of Michigan consumer sentiment.
Other factors at work next week will be:
1. Ongoing concern over margin debt which is at record highs and which usually peaks near stock market highs.
2. The bull market?s fifth birthday last month which makes this a longer than average bull run.
3. New concern voiced by Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher, a new voting member and hawk, suggesting that the Fed needed to watch for stock market bubbles and new irrational exuberance.
4. Excessive valuations, now comparable to levels seen at the 2007 peak.
A quick glance at the chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reveals that the market is close to overbought levels and approaching significant resistance.
Dow Jones Industrials Daily
Bottom line: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and other major indexes continue to climb while valuations and margin debt flash warnings.

Wall Street opens lower after S&P's record close,http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/154063/wall-street-opens-lower-after-sps-record-close,Buenos Aires Herald,"Monday, March 10, 2014
S&P dips after record; China data, Boeing weigh
US stocks dipped today, weighed down by soft data out of China and Boeing's latest production setback.
Merger and acquisition announcements, however, as well as company-specific news including on Facebook and Alexion Pharma, helped keep the S&P 500 and Nasdaq from bigger losses.
China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.04 points or 0.21 percent, to 16,418.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.87 points or 0.05 percent, to 1,877.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.775 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,334.448.
The S&P 500 had closed at a record of 1,878.04 on Friday.
European shares fell for the second straight session today. Most European indexes swung lower in the afternoon after the Interfax news agency reported Russian troops had opened fire with automatic rifles during a takeover of a Ukrainian naval post in Crimea.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.4 percent lower at 1,320.98 points after re-testing a low set last week earlier in the session, in a broad sell-off involving most sectors.
Japanese shares retreated from a five-week high as disappointing Chinese trade data and uncertainty over the crisis in Ukraine prompted investors to lock in recent gains.
The benchmark Nikkei closed down 1 percent at 15,120.14, slipping from a five-week peak hit on Friday, in thin trading volume.

Stocks futures edge lower on weak Chinese export data,http://seekingalpha.com/news/1616793-stocks-futures-edge-lower-on-weak-chinese-export-data,Seeking Alpha,"Stocks futures edge lower on weak Chinese export data
Mar. 10, 2014  9:25 AM ET
|By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor
Stock futures slip as surprisingly weak trade data out of China looks set to stop the market's run to record highs after Friday's upbeat U.S. jobs report; A&P and Dow -0.2%, Nasdaq flat.
Asian markets finished broadly lower, with China's Shanghai Composite -2.9% to a near two-month low on the disappointing trade data; European shares are mixed.
While the Chinese data is of some concern, money manager Kent Engelke says ""it's just a good reason for some profit-taking after a great run that we've had... I don't see any great issues that could cause the market to trade down substantially from here.""
The Chinese numbers are weighing on the materials sector, as Cliffs Natural -2% and Freeport McMoRan -1.5% premarket.
Treasury enter the session little changed, with the 10-year yield just below 2.79%.

Five  Biggest Stories in Today's Stock Market, March 10, 2014
Big  Money in Whistle Blowing: The U.S. government announced it will award J.P.  Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) whistleblower Keith  Edwards a staggering $63.9 million for his assistance. Edwards provided tips  about the bank's alleged scheme to offer false data and information since 2002  to the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The  sum represents more than 10% of the total figure that the company paid last  month in a $614 million settlement over its mortgage lending practices. According  to multiple reports, federal agencies faced ""substantial losses"" from  JPMorgan's actions, which included the approval of thousands of loans that failed  to adhere to underwriting guidelines.
Whom  Does Earth Owe? Since the onset of the financial crisis, global debt  has now soared by 40% to top $100 trillion. As countries and central banks took  advantage of low interest rates, and companies sold a record total of bonds,  high borrowing accelerated the international debt markets, according to the  Bank for International Settlements. This figure is now well ahead of global GDP  of roughly $71.83 trillion in nominal terms.
This  Deal Is Bananas: Two of the world's largest fruit companies, Chiquita  Brands International Inc. (NYSE: CQB ) and Ireland-based Fyffes PLC (OTC: FYFFF ) agreed this morning to merge in an all-stock deal worth nearly $1.07 billion.  The deal creates ChiquitaFyffes, the world's largest banana supplier with $4.6  billion in revenue and more than 32,000 workers. Shareholders of the newly  combined company will benefit from significant tax savings by domiciling in  Ireland.
The  Cell Phone Wars Continue: AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T ) announced plans to slash prices on wireless plan subscriptions for the second  time in 2014. The company is attempting to stave off a charge from rival T-Mobile  US Inc. (NYSE: TMUS ) while  aiming to reduce a surge in phone subsidies across the United States. The  company announced cuts in monthly plan costs offering unlimited calls and texts  on individual smartphones with two  gigabytes of data by $15, or 19%. Subscribers must use an existing phone or  purchase a new device at full price to take advantage of the cost savings. This  comes at a time that rival T-Mobile actually increased its pricing as it adds  subscribers.
Buffett  Wins Big: Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK/B ) announced its largest weekly gain in 14 months. Berkshire shares have jumped 5.8%  since Feb. 28 to drive its market cap above $300 billion for the first time  ever. Company B shares hit a  new high of $121.44, with a one-year increase of almost 17%.
Note: The Fed's 2014 taper means volatility ahead. So we've  outlined how to find profits in a volatile market ? like triple-digit gains in  just days ? if you start with this strategy?

* Futures down: Dow 28 pts, S&P 3 pts, Nasdaq 1 pts
By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK, March 10 U.S. stocks were set to open slightly lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&P 500, following unexpectedly weak data in China which tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.
* China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.
* The data put a damper on positive sentiment generated by Friday's better-than-expected U.S. payrolls report, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high for a second consecutive session.
* Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 1.4 percent to $31.74 in premarket trade as concerns over China sent London copper to an eight-month low.
* Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P's 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.
* In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.
* S&P 500 e-mini futures slipped 3 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures  shed 28 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1 point.
* McDonald's Corp reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.
* Boeing Co shares lost 1.2 percent to $127.06 in premarket trading after the plane maker said on Friday that ""hairline cracks"" had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company's newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an ""unprecedented aviation mystery,"" a senior official said on Monday.
* The situation in Ukraine remained unsettled. Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine, blaming the far-right paramilitary movement Right Sector for ""conniving"" with the new government in Kiev. Germany's Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution.
* Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe's largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world's biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 18.1 percent to $12.80 in premarket trade.
* United Rentals Inc, the world's largest equipment rental company, said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.

"Stock futures ease as Chinese trade, payrolls compete",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-futures-ease-as-chinese-trade-payrolls-compete-2014-03-10\?link=MW_latest_news,MarketWatch,"? CHARTS: If the S&P 500 repeat past bull runs
Data over the weekend showed Chinese exports unexpectedly fell 18.1% in February, compared with a year earlier, which left a trade deficit of $22.98 billion for the month. Economists had been expecting an expansion of 5%, and the number was also well off a rise of 10.6% in January.
?The shock drop in exports raises serious questions about how realistic Chinese growth prospects are and casts doubt on their current target,? said Rebecca O?Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor. ?This increased uncertainty is not helpful for either the commodity market or wider global-equity markets.?
Asian markets fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -0.24% ?down nearly 3%. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.71% ?lost 1%. Also coming under pressure were the Australian dollar USDAUD, -0.2783% ?and copper prices US:HGK4 ? the latter fell more than 1%. Oil prices were also sharply lower, with April crude US:CLJ4 ?off more than 1%.
Stock futures struggled between the flat line and losses, and European markets also traded choppy.
?We think this is just the market trying to weigh out two real stories: The positive numbers from payrolls against Chinese numbers overnight, and it almost seems the positivity of payrolls has won out over China,? said James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari U.K.
Some are cautious as the S&P 500 is up more than 170% since its March 9, 2009 low. That string of S&P 500 highs, along with levels of margin debt and a small number of prior bull markets that have made it this far, are among reasons why some investors are wary.

Shipping containers are seen piled up at a port in Qingdao, Shandong province in China on Dec. 10, 2013.
Hughes said that markets were also ignoring negative data that arrived in 2008, near the beginning of the euro crisis. While investors will be keeping an eye on geopolitical situations such as Ukraine, at the moment, he said it is just hard to bet against the market.

Don't Chase Stocks in This Five-Year-Old Bull,http://investorplace.com/2014/03/daily-stock-market-news-dont-chase-stocks-five-year-old-bull/,Investorplace.com,"View All Posts
On Friday, stocks closed mixed following a positive week that saw new highs in a majority of the widely followed indices. Friday?s non-farm payrolls report showed an increase of 175,000 jobs in February versus an expected 152,000. But the unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6% in January.
The Nasdaq was weak as a second day of profit-taking in the biotech sector coupled with weakness late in the day in other technology stocks kept a lid on a possible recovery. The S&P 500 held onto its gains thanks to strength in the financial sector, which posted a 3% gain for the week.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31 points to 16,453, the S&P 500 rose 1 point to 1,878, and the Nasdaq fell 16 points to 4,336. The NYSE?s primary market traded 723 million shares with total volume of 3.6 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.1 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners outpaced advancers by 1.3-to-1, while on the Nasdaq, there were only slightly more decliners than advancers.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.8%, the S&P 500 gained 1%, the Nasdaq was up 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.7%.
Click to Enlarge
The Nasdaq broke to a new 13-year closing high on Thursday but gave back the gains on Friday. The index is slowing its advance slightly, and that is showing in MACD and other momentum indicators. Immediate support rests at the 20-day moving average, and a fall to that level would close the gap opened earlier in the week.
Click to Enlarge
The Russell 2000 broke to new intraday and closing highs last week. The breakout was from a very bullish ?V? formation that bottomed precisely at its intermediate trendline early in February. Both MACD and momentum are strong, but a small horn formation has developed, which could slow the advance until that is resolved.
Conclusion: Despite economic and political uncertainties, stocks continue to make new highs. The advance is characteristic of a bull market that has considerable strength behind it. Institutional interest is demonstrated by higher-than-average block trading, while average investors? bearishness increased by over 5% last week, according to AAII?s sentiment survey.
I focused on the small- and mid-cap stocks for this report, but the broad-based S&P 500 scored four consecutive new intraday highs last week. The highs were accompanied by higher volume, and group rotation was very active.
Everything points to higher prices, but that doesn?t mean that daily adjustments won?t occur. When they do, we should use them to take new positions in high-quality, oversold stocks. Patience is the key to success, and chasing stocks that are making new highs is a high-risk proposition in a stock market that is celebrating its fifth year as a bull.

Mumbai: US jobs figures cleared some of the clouds over the country?s economic outlook on Friday raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold firm in gradually scaling back its support for the recovery, reports Financial Times . 175,000 jobs were added in February up from 129,000 in January and 84,000 in December. The S&P 500 gained 0.1%, Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4% and Dow Jones Industrial was up 0.2%.
Asian markets were trading lower on Monday morning following weak data from China and Japan. Japan?s Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.9% after worse-than-expected revision to already weak fourth quarter GDP data. Hong Kong?s Hang Seng declined 1.2% while China?s Shanghai Composite was down 1.6% after a 18% slump in exports in February.
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd shares will be under pressure as it is reeling under a flurry of regulatory rebukes due to manufacturing quality concerns.

Indian Oil Corp. Ltd shares will be in limelight as it is acquiring a 10% stake in shale gas assets on Canada?s West coast from Malaysia?s Petronas Bhd , which will allow it to source 1.2 million tonnes of LNG (liquefied natural gas) per annum for 20 years, reports Mint .
State run banks are finding it difficult to recover their money from defaulting borrowers although mounting bad loans put pressure on their capital base, reports Mint . State-run banks are pushing officials to do door-to-door recovery and are employing call centres for follow-up action.
The finance ministry?s nudge to force some top executives at state-run banks to resign recently shows it is running out of patience with the rising tide of bad loans and wants closer scrutiny of officials responsible for it, reports Economic Times .

3 Predictions for the New Week,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/09/3-predictions-for-the-new-week.aspx,Motley Fool,"3 Predictions for the New Week
There are always calls to be made, because the market never sleeps.
Rick Munarriz
( TMFBreakerRick )
Mar 9, 2014 at 3:00PM
I went out on a limb last week , and now it's time to see how that decision played out.
I predicted that RadioShack ( NYSE:RSHCQ ) would post a wider loss than expected. The struggling small-box retailer of wireless products and other consumer electronics was having a hard time keeping its red ink in check in recent quarters, and larger chains had already provided uninspiring snapshots of the niche. Well, the report was brutal. RadioShack's adjusted loss of $1.29 a share was far worse than the $0.13 analysts were forecasting. I was right.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) has been strong lately, but my second prediction still called for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to outpace the Dow. It was close, but the Dow's 0.8% advance squeaked past Nasdaq's 0.7% gain. I was wrong.
My final call was for Ambarella ( NASDAQ:AMBA ) to beat Wall Street's income estimates in its latest quarter. The provider of system-on-chip solutions for the HD camera industry has been riding high with its handiwork found in GoPro sports enthusiasts' cameras and Dropcam home security products. Ambarella closed out the quarter with an adjusted profit of $0.26 a share. Analysts had been banking on net income of $0.19. I was right.
Two out of three? I can live with that! I have now gone a solid 20 out of 24 over the past eight weeks.
Let me once again whip out my trusty, dusty, and occasionally accurate crystal ball to make three calls that may play out over the next few trading days.
1. Novavax will post a wider loss than expected
Novavax ( NASDAQ:NVAX ) is a widely traded maker of vaccines. It moved higher late last month after extending its contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences to develop seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.
Unfortunately, Novavax is losing money, and analysts seem to underestimate the red ink. Wall Street has failed to nail its projections when it comes to Novavax, aiming for a much smaller deficit than what the vaccine maker ultimately reports.
Why get in the way of a long-running streak? My first call is for Novavax to post a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street's projecting this week.
2. The Nasdaq will beat the Dow this week
I've routinely picked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but I've been switching things out in recent weeks. I'm going back to my original call this time around, betting on a strong week for tech now that earnings season is starting to wind down. This approach didn't pan out for me this past week, but that won't deter me.
My second call is for the Nasdaq Composite to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the week.
3. magicJack VocalTec will beat Wall Street's earnings estimates
Some stocks are just flat-out better than others.
magicJack VocalTec ( NASDAQ:CALL ) is a provider of Web-based phone services. Consumers looking to save money have been ditching traditional landlines, and the VoIP pioneer has sold 10 million of its magicJack devices.
Another thing it does is make analysts look like perpetual underachievers. If analysts say the company posted a profit of $0.19 a share in its latest quarter, I'll argue that it held up better than that. History's on my side!
One of my best tricks to beating the market is finding stocks that perpetually land ahead of the prognosticators. Let's go over the past year of earnings reports.

The Dow's 5 Most Hated Stocks
The Dow Jones Industrial Average may be near a record high, but short-sellers have been unrelenting with these five components.
Sean Williams
( TMFUltraLong )
Mar 8, 2014 at 7:01PM
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) may not be knocking off new all-time highs on a daily basis like the broader market S&P 500, but it is once again with striking distance of a new high as it's rebounded ferociously off its beginning-of-the-year swoon.
Helping the Dow move decisively higher has been a steady recovery in the U.S. economy, aided by a double-digit rise in home prices, a precipitous fall in the unemployment rate, improving worker productivity, and the continuation of historically low lending rates.
But are things really as they appear?
Two months ago we looked at three variables that may be inflating how strong the U.S. economy actually looks. The first is the labor participation rate, which has been falling consistently for the past 14 years. Some of this drop is expected as baby boomers hit their retirement age and others go back to school, but a growing concern is that some people have simply given up on finding work. Comparing the current number of employed workers with those in mid-2008, you'd see that job creation is basically flat.
Second, the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus, QE3, has been a boost for the housing and banking sector, but has spoiled the U.S. consumer by keeping rates too low for too long, By artificially keeping rates low and reducing this sense of urgency, consumers have drastically cut back on loan originations anytime lending rates tick up in the slightest.
Finally, a combination of stock buybacks and cost-cutting has helped push corporate earnings higher, but it's also masking what has generally been weak organic growth.
With these points in mind, I suggest we do what we do every month, which is to take a closer look at the Dow's five most hated companies -- in essence, the five stocks with the highest level of short interest -- to better understand what characteristics, if any, are attracting short-sellers so we can avoid buying similar stocks in the future.
Here are the Dow's five most hated stocks.
Company
Source: S&P Capital IQ.
Caterpillar
Why are investors shorting Caterpillar?
The bet against heavy-duty machinery manufacturer Caterpillar has grown dramatically within just the past month, rising from 3.46% last month to 5.96% this month. The reason for the recent run higher was its sizable earnings beat in the fourth quarter , which was a complete surprise after Caterpillar had lowered its earnings guidance on three separate occasions last year. Short-sellers are betting that this past quarter, which was aided primarily by cost-cutting, was nothing more than a fluke, and that weak mining demand will continue to weigh on Caterpillar's share price.
Is this short interest warranted?
With Caterpillar's management remaining cautious in 2013 and not exactly knowing when this protracted downtrend in heavy-duty machinery would end, I'd suggest that a high level of skepticism could be warranted, at least in the interim. Over the long run, Caterpillar is well positioned globally and has incredible pricing and brand power, which should translate into decades of growth potential, especially in emerging markets. Over the near term, though, stagnant commodity prices could put a cap on any upside in Caterpillar's share price and play right into the hands of short-sellers.
Patrick Gelsinger, Intel Sr. VP, Source: Intel.
Intel
Why are investors shorting Intel?
The bet against Intel hasn't changed in more than a year now, with pessimists counting on Intel's PC processing business to slowly shrink, and for the company to have to spend heavily on research and development to play catch-up with regard to mobile processing and the cloud. The end result has been stagnant top- and bottom-line growth for Intel, which short-sellers suspect will weigh on Intel's share price.
Is this short interest warranted?
Pessimists do have a point about continued PC declines, with research firm IDC upping its estimate this past week from an expected 3.8% decline in 2014 to 6.1%. Furthermore, IDC anticipates that PC sales will decline through 2018.While that's not good news for Intel, what is good news is that it'll still be able to generate significant cash flow from its dominant position as the processing king of PCs to fund its mobile and cloud-based R&D. Intel has already shown small snippets of success in penetrating the mobile tablet market and should be a major player in cloud-based hardware by the end of the decade. I believe you'd be doing yourself a disservice by writing off Intel here.
AT&T
Why are investors shorting AT&T?
The reason short-sellers have piled into AT&T has nothing to do with poor results. It merely has to do with the risk-on investing approach we're witnessing throughout the market that has traders cycling out of traditionally defensive names like AT&T, which grows at very slow but steady rate, and instead focusing on seeking out riskier but higher-growth investments. In addition, relative to Verizon, AT&T is trailing in 4G LTE-capable cities, meaning it'll have to spend bountifully if it hopes to catch its main rival. 4G LTE is a strong lure in the U.S. to gaining new smartphone subscribers.
Is this short interest warranted?
Somehow this short trade has indeed worked for pessimists over the past year, but I doubt it'll work over the long run. Sectorwide consolidation should help tighten AT&T's costs (AT&T is purchasing Leap Wireless), and mobile devices have practically become necessity products for much of today's consumers. What this means for AT&T is steady cash flow, a healthy dividend that's currently yielding 5.8%, and few reasons to bet against the company .
Verizon
Why are investors shorting Verizon?
Although telecom giants Verizon and AT&T switched spots this month, with AT&T leapfrogging Verizon in a bad way, the story is almost exactly the same for both. Like AT&T, Verizon bears a high number of short-sellers because it's generally a slower-growth business model that simply won't be able to keep up with the double-digit growth traders are witnessing in the networking and cloud-tech space. As investors cycle out of these defensive names, they tend to slowly tick lower.
Is this short interest warranted?
Let me be clear that I don't think betting against AT&T or Verizon is a smart idea, but with the recent acquisition of its remaining unowned interest in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone, coupled with its sizable lead in rolling out 4G LTE-capable networks across the U.S., Verizon makes even less sense than AT&T to bet against. Verizon is paying out a premium 4.4% yield, and at 12 times forward earnings it looks ripe as a possible buy, if you ask me.
IBM
Why are investors shorting IBM?
Are you noticing the major tech bias on this list of the Dow's most hated companies? No. 2 through No. 5 are all tech or telecom based! IBM finds its way onto this list for many similar reasons as Intel. IBM has seen its hardware division get whacked by weakening demand, and, like Intel, has had to beef up its R&D spending to develop new cloud-based products. Pessimists believes that Big Blue may simply have fallen too far behind not to see its EPS erode in the near-term.
Is this short interest warranted?
On the surface, IBM looks like a company that should be avoided as it transitions to a number of new products. However, with the backing of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway?as a major shareholder, as well as its incredibly strong cash flow, I'd suggest that short-sellers would probably be wise to lock in their gains now and keep their distance. With its forward P/E of just 9 , I've even added IBM to my personal watchlist as a possible buy candidate.

This Week's Top Dow Stocks
Despite turmoil between Russia and Ukraine, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had a solid week and financial stocks led the way.
Travis Hoium
( TMFFlushDraw )
Mar 8, 2014 at 1:00PM
Ukraine and Russia were the talk of the markets this week and made for some wild trading. Stocks were down big Monday when tensions increased, but Tuesday was one of the best days of the year, and by the end of the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) was up 0.80%.
Russia is the world's largest oil producer, so it's worth keeping an eye on how it handles Ukraine and the region of Crimea, but the harsh drop of Russian stocks and the ruble on Monday may have been the warning it needed to not escalate the conflict. Russia's economy is on fragile ground, and markets showed that they'd crush Russian assets if a military conflict erupts.
While Russia garnered headlines, it was financial stocks that led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher this week. Goldman Sachs ( NYSE:GS ) was the top stock, gaining 4.7%. Outside of hiring Apple's retiring CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for its board of directors, there wasn't a lot of news out about Goldman this week. Goldman continues to benefit from the strong market for underwriting stock and bond offerings, and as long as the economy continues to improve, the finance giant will fare well.
JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE:JPM ) rose 4.5% this week and settled another lawsuit. The company agreed to pay $400 million to Syncora Guarantee to settle mortgage-backed-securities lawsuits. The bond insurer was claiming JPMorgan misrepresented the quality of loans in securitized and therefore increased liabilities to Syncora. This is on top of $23 billion in fines and settlements last year, but thus far it's done little to slow down JPMorgan's stock. ?
American Express ( NYSE:AXP ) was up 2.8% to round out the top three stocks this week. Again, there was little significant news, but the slowly improving economy is helping revenue and earnings as consumers spend more money. The other advantage American Express has is that it more heavily targets affluent consumers than its rivals do. Those consumers are doing well in this economy, which will bode well for American Express long-term.

A Secular Bull Market Arises From the 2009 Shadows
Charts and investor psychology both point to a new secular bull market in the S&P 500
By Serge Berger , Head Trader & Strategist, The Steady Trader??|?? Mar 10, 2014, 12:13 pm EDT

Respect the bear, but never fear it. That?s a lesson every investor should take away from the panic of 2009, and it?s applicable everywhere ? even now, as we sit around all-time highs.
I remember the scene as if it was yesterday: It was Sept. 15, 2008, and investment banking giant Lehman Bros. had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The S&P 500 fell more than 4.5% on the day, and as I left the office around 6pm after a busy trading day in Manhattan, the streets were quiet ? much too quiet for New York City.
On any other day, a sea of yellow cabs greeted me right outside my building in mid-town Manhattan, but not on Sept. 15. I found myself walking a few blocks north just to find a cab. It was eerie. With the financial epicenter of the globe being shaken to the core that day, the fear in the air was palpable.
The market eventually would take the market through a shaky autumn and winter. In fact, it wouldn?t be until six months later, while headlines of doom and gloom were still flying faster than ever, that the market began to climb out of the abyss. On March 6, 2009, the S&P 500 finally capitulated to the ironic intraday level of 666, then on March 9, the market hit its closing low point at 676.53. A day later, stocks saw a big follow-through buying day, with the index rallying more than 6%.
As it usually goes, neither the media nor the investing crowd took the March 10 bounce as anything more than a short-lived lift, and those smart enough to buy kept very quiet. But to me, it became clearer that considering the typical six-month lag in which the market works, coupled with the still-paralyzed investing public, at least a medium-term bottom was in place.
I wasn?t smart/dumb enough to go all-in on stocks that day either, but because the psychological picture seemed to match up with what I saw on the charts, I knew better not to be caught short the market at the time.
I was right.
Of Bulls and Bears
The general story in terms of bull and bear markets, particularly in the S&P 500, is that roughly every 13- to 17-year bull market is followed by a 10- to 15-year bear. (The Great Depression, depending on when you?re measuring from, stands out as an exception.)
So, looking at the below chart of the S&P 500, which spans all the way back to 1927, this rhythm should somewhat stand out. After a flat tape the bear market from the mid-?60s through the early ?80s, the S&P 500 began its great bull run. Aside from the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, the bull market really kept running until the dot-com bubble of the late ?90s and early aughts popped. This then led to the ?lost decade? and the easy monetary policy introduced by then-Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, during which stocks wildly gyrated and ultimately bottomed five years ago ? in March 2009.
Click to Enlarge
Looking at the past 20 or so years of trading in the S&P 500 a little more closely, what stands out on the below weekly chart is that the March 2009 capitulation marginally and classically broke below the index?s 2002 lows. This helped to wash out all those players who placed their stop-loss orders around this area, and paved the path for the steep and vicious rally we have witnessed since.
The nail in the coffin for the bears came in spring 2013, when the S&P 500 broke to fresh all-time highs, leaving behind the market tops from 2000 and 2007.
Click to Enlarge
This has, in my opinion, given birth to a new secular bull market ? the long 13- to 17-year type of cycle that I discussed above.
However, with the cyclical bull market now five years of age, it is slowly but surely getting somewhat long in the tooth. While many sectors and industries/groups of stocks still look good on the long side, it is somewhat too early to clear the portfolio and or lean short this market. But if history is any guide, then at some point over the next three to nine months, a first cyclical bear market will throw investors a curveball.
The thing to remember when all turns to panic (which it inevitably will) is that if we do indeed find ourselves in a new secular bull market, then the next cyclical bear should lead to a correction no bigger than roughly 30%.
That would mean the major breakout that the S&P 500 staged in spring 2013 when it broke past long-term highs around 1,550 could easily get retested at some point.
And if it does, just remember ? the market always bounces back.

Winners and losers of the bull market,http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/09/investing/stock-market-lookahead/,CNNMoney,"Winners and losers of the bull market
by Ben Rooney ? @ben_rooney March 10, 2014: 9:36 AM ET
The past five years have been very good to some blue chip companies. But some missed the stock market rally.
It's been five years since the stock market hit its low point of the financial crisis and Great Recession.
While the current bull market is already longer than average, most market strategists expect stocks to have another good year in 2014 . Stocks gained last week, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs, despite the ongoing crisis in Ukraine . The Dow Jones industrial average is less than 1% away from its all-time high.
But with little economic and corporate earnings news on tap this week, it may be tough for stocks to move much higher. So instead of our usual preview of the days ahead, we've decided to take a look back at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks of the past five years.
Related: Extreme greed is driving the market
Online travel companies Priceline ( PCLN ) and Expedia ( EXPE ) are two of the biggest winners of the bull market. Priceline shares have surged 1,646% and Expedia has soared 1,182% during the past five years.
Fast-growing consumer stocks have also done well, including Chipotle ( CMG ), Whole Foods ( WFM ) and Starbucks ( SBUX ). Wynn Resorts ( WYNN ), the casino company, and Netflix ( NFLX ) were big winners as well. Those stocks also gained at least 1,000%.
Big tech companies Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) had slightly less spectacular gains. They're in a group of stocks that have gained between 500% and 1,000% since March 2009. Ford ( F ) and Delta Airlines ( DAL ), two companies that were hit hard during the recession, are also among the companies that have far outpaced the S&P 500's gain of nearly 180%.
But there were a few stocks that have been left behind.
Best Buy isn't best stock to buy
Avon Products ( AVP ), Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ) and Cliffs Natural Resources ( CLF ) were big laggards. Best Buy ( BBY ), which was one of the best performers in 2013, is still up only 4% in the past five years.
And a few stocks actually missed the rally entirely. Shares of Staples ( SPLS ), which recently announced plans to close hundreds of stores , have fallen. First Solar ( FSLR ) shares are down 47% over the past five years, giving it the dubious distinction as the bull market's biggest loser.

NEW YORK ?
Happy 5th birthday, bull market.
The current bull run is not the longest, or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the U.S. government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.
Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 178 percent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.
A bull market is a rise of 20 percent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 percent or more. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.
The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P 500 index fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the U.S. economy. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Barack Obama and several other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.
Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.
There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October 1990 and March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4-1/2 years, making the current one longer than average.
The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was taking hold. The S&P 500 index dropped 57 percent from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009, before bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.
Typically, bull markets end when investors get spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving and consumer confidence is rising.
Inflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it hikes interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.
But with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero for an extended period.
Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next twelve months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, stands at 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.
The stock market is ""not cheap, but it's not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice,"" Manley says.
The bull market's gain is above the average advance of 141 percent for S&P 500 bulls. But it is well short of the 417 percent jump from October 1990 to March 2000.
Here is what's changed since the bull run began:
HERE'S WHAT YOU COULD'VE WON
Since starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent.  If you'd played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays U.S. aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market. If you'd played it even safer and invested in short-term government debt, certificates of deposit and other short-term debt securities, your return would be even smaller. Fidelity's money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent over the same period.
BEST PERFORMERS
The best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index during the five year bull market are a drugmaker, a hotel company and a broadcaster. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an experimental asthma drug, has climbed from $12.40 in March 2009 to $328.11 on Friday. That's a cumulative return of 2,546 percent, making it the best-performing stock since the start of the rally. Wyndham Worldwide, a hotel and lodging company that owns the Ramada and Days Inn, has soared from $3.10 to $75.70 as demand for hotels revives. The company has also raised its dividend. CBS has climbed from $3.09 to $67.40 as advertising revenue increased.
THE LAGGARDS
Among stocks still in the S&P 500 index since the start of the bull market, the worst performers are a solar panel maker, a mining company and a supplier of wholesale electric power.
First Solar's shares are down from $108.36 to $56.11, a drop of 48 percent. The company has struggled to adapt to sharply lower panel prices. Newmont Mining has dropped from $37.79 to $24.60, hurt by falling gold and copper prices. Exelon, the nation's largest supplier of wholesale electric power, has dropped from $43.84 to $29.82 as electricity prices have fallen.
THE ECONOMY
When the stock market hit rock bottom, the economy was struggling, too. Jobs were harder to find five years ago and the U.S. had yet to emerge from the Great Recession. Economic growth has since strengthened, but the recovery remains slow.
When the bull market began in March 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent. It rose to 10 percent in October that year, its highest level in 26 years. It has since fallen, and was 6.7 percent in February.
COMPANY PROFITS
S&P 500 companies earned an average of $60.81 per share in 2009. Those earnings are projected to almost double to $118.16 by the end of this year, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Corporate profits have climbed as companies have cut costs and demand has revived.
NEW FACES
Twitter shares now trade in the stock market, following its initial public offering in November. Facebook had a $16 billion IPO in May of 2012 and became a member of the S&P 500 in December. Outside of social media, luxury clothing and accessories maker Michael Kors has been one of the more successful market debutants. Its IPO was in December 2011 and it joined the S&P 500 in November.
RETURN OF THE RICH
Like the stock market, billionaires have also staged a comeback.
In 2009, the number of billionaires in the world shrank by 30 percent to 793, with an aggregate wealth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes. The latest list of billionaires published last week shows that their ranks have more than doubled to 1,645, with a combined wealth of $6.4 trillion. The rebounding stock market has helped boost those numbers.
Bill Gates is back on top this year as the world's richest person. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist reclaimed the spot from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who topped the list for the previous four years. Gates' net worth is estimated at $76 billion, compared with $40 billion in 2009.
CAR COMEBACK
The American auto industry has roared back. Crushed by unsustainable debt and sliding sales, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and got government funding to help it recover. Since then, it has ditched its Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer and Saab lines. The automaker returned to the stock market in November 2010. Its stock closed at $37.69 on Friday, and is up 35 percent in the past year. Chrysler also filed for bankruptcy and has been acquired by Italian automaker Fiat. The only big U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy was Ford. Its stock has surged from $1.74 in March 2009 to $15.62 as of Thursday -- gain of 800 percent.

What Comes Next as the Bull Market Turns Five?
This bull, the second strongest since WWII, still looks strong
Mar 10, 2014, 9:30 am EDT ??|??By Editor , Zacks Investment Research
? ?
The current bull market turned five this weekend. ?On Mar 9, 2009, the S&P 500 index touched a low of 676.13; it?s up 177% since then.
The average length of bull markets since 1921 is 62 months, while average gains are 180%. On the other hand, median gain and length are just 115% and 50 months respectively.
Last bull market ended days after it turned five in October 2007. But according to Capital IQ, bull markets have added another 26% gain if they survived for another year after their fifth anniversary.
Most investors expect the market to go up this year and the path of least resistance for US equities is still up, even though this bull market has been the second strongest since World War II (chart from WSJ).
But can this ageing bull maintain its momentum? Are you turning cautious now??

What the bull market has meant for Europe,http://www.cnbc.com/id/101479206,CNBC.com,"(Read more: Bull market may still have some sizzle )
The FTSEurofirst300 , an index which ranks the 300 largest companies in Europe by market capitalization, has almost doubled over the same period, closing at 1326.7 at the end of last week. This happened despite the euro zone debt crisis and the bailout of weaker euro zone states like Greece and Ireland threatening the region's stability.
Greek equities are one of only two major asset classes (the other is the U.S. dollar) to fall over the period, and are down 30 percent ? but this followed a huge credit crisis which some worried would force the country to leave the euro.
The bull market shows how faith in the will of the European Central Bank and European governments to keep the euro afloat has been restored. Confidence in European equities has returned.
The recent unrest in Ukraine, which some feared could be the kind of black swan event that derails markets, caused a minor dip in European stock markets which has since recovered.
A prolonged military conflict or sanctions may disrupt the region's gas supply from Russia.

Persistent slow growth in the region's biggest economies is potentially more damaging.
""Earnings and economic growth have been (and we believe will continue to be) lackluster, and without growth or central bank liquidity, we see no generic reason to be bullish of European equities,"" Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management, warned.
(Read more: Why bull market is like sex: Warren Buffett )
There is a risk of excess liquidity causing ""excess valuations in a narrow range of assets"" ? or asset bubbles like the dotcom bubble of the early years of the twenty-first century, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. So, roughly, if the flight out of emerging markets continues, then the price of assets like London real estate or peripheral euro zone bonds could reach unrealistic heights.
""There are eerie similarities with the 1998-99 period,"" the BoAML strategists warned.
There are also concerns over European equities' exposure to emerging markets, which account for around 25 percent of European corporate revenues according to UBS research. Panic over the emerging markets has distilled slightly since last year's major sell-off, but is still in the backdrop of market movements.

Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ.
The Standard & Poor?s 500 index is up 178 percent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.
Its advance has been driven by massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve, a drawdown in debt, and a rebound in corporate profits.
The S&P 500 ended Friday at a record high at 1,878.04. Over the same time span, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 150 percent while the Nasdaq has rocketed more than 240 percent.

The Bull Market Turns 5: Don't Break Out the Bubbly,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/03/09/Bull-Market-Turns-5-Don-t-Break-Out-Champagne,The Fiscal Times,"Picture of the Day
Happy birthday, bull market.
If that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven?t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I?m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we?re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.
I?d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then ? the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends ? but that?s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.
Related: Confident Market Remains Watchful for Ukraine Disruption
Of course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.
At the same time, it?s not easy to follow Warren Buffett?s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence ? a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks ? has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.
Whatever the reason for the average investor?s reluctance to load up on stocks, it?s clear they haven?t benefitted as much from the market?s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve ? about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains .
Let?s put to one side the vexing question of whether that?s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market?s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed ? most dramatically during the course of 2013 ? but personal earnings and profits didn?t .
By the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon , it was already 2013. The lion?s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well. ?
The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It?s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth . And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.
The Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It?s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed?s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales. ??
That doesn?t mean that we?re about to careen off the edge of a cliff ? clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.
It?s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market?s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.
If you haven?t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so ? and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.

The 10 Best Stocks of the Bull Market,http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/investing/T052-S003-the-10-best-stocks-of-the-bull-market/,Kiplinger Personal Finance,"The 10 Best Stocks of the Bull Market
1. Pharmacyclics
Five-year total return: 19,213% (189% annualized)
52-week price range:$71.85-$154.89
Price-earnings ratio: Not meaningful
Market capitalization: $10.4 billion
Biotechnology has been one of the hottest sectors for the past two years, and no stock shows that better than Pharmacyclics ( PCYC ), which takes the crown as the biggest winner of the five-year-old bull market. A $1,000 investment in the Sunnyvale, Cal., company's shares at the market?s bottom in March 2009 is worth a stunning $177,557 today.
The buzz began to build in 2011 for Pharmacyclics's drug Imbruvica, a new treatment for blood cancers such as leukemia. The company that year signed a deal with Johnson & Johnson to develop and market the drug. Last November, the two firms got Food and Drug Administration approval to start selling Imbruvica for a rare blood cancer. In February, the FDA approved the drug for a more common leukemia. Sales have already surged, and analysts on average expect Pharmacyclics's revenues to jump from $260 million in 2013 to $405 million this year and $778 million in 2015. They expect earnings at 8 cents a share this year, then see profits surging to 65 cents a share in 2015.
The real excitement is about broader future uses for Imbruvica in cancer treatment. That's what is driving analysts' extremely bullish outlook for the 23-year-old firm. Robyn Karnauskas, of Deutsche Bank Securities, sees revenues of $4 billion and earnings of $15.66 a share by 2018 and sees the stock at $180 in 12 months. But as the past year has shown, a major challenge for long-term believers in Pharmacyclics is dealing with wild short-term trading in the stock.
Bottom line: Likely to stay a hot stock, but suitable for big risk takers only. How patient can you be?

Five-year loss: -48% (-12% annualized)
52-week price range: $15.98-$35.92
Price-earnings ratio: 16*
Market capitalization: $3.7 billion
For-profit education was supposed to be one of the hot growth industries of the 21st century. What investors didn't anticipate was Uncle Sam busting into the classroom and handing out an F ? to the professor.
Education companies, including Phoenix-based Apollo ( APOL ), have had a rough five years as federal and state authorities have zeroed in on alleged predatory practices. At worst, regulators say, for-profit educators have aggressively recruited students, persuaded them to borrow heavily to pay for school, then provided them lousy training that has left too many unable to find work after graduating (if they graduated). The government's crackdown ratcheted up in February, when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued ITT Educational Services for allegedly exploiting students and warned of more actions to come.
For Apollo, which owns University of Phoenix, the pall cast by the government's crackdown has helped drag down enrollment. So revenue fell from a peak of $4.9 billion in 2010 to $3.7 billion last year, pulling earnings down as well. Although Apollo?s stock has lost nearly half its value during the bull market, it and most other education stocks have been recovering. Yet many analysts remain cautious. ""As the best-known name in the higher-education group, Apollo is likely to benefit when investor confidence in the sector rebounds from the bottom,"" says Trace Urdan, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. But with enrollment continuing to slide, ""it's still too early to declare an inflection"" in the outlook, Urdan says.
Bottom line: For-profit education will survive, but just how profitable the industry will be is the big question mark. That argues against paying up for the stocks.

Happy 5th birthday, Mr. Bull Market -- it seems like only yesterday that you sprang from the loins of a dying Bear. Yet, on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) put in its crisis low of 676.53. Investors had given up on stocks in an environment in which they were being bombarded with seemingly catastrophic headlines on a daily basis.
Seven days earlier, troubled insurer AIG had reported a $61.7 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 -- the largest loss in U.S. corporate history. Two days after that, General Motors disclosed to its shareholders in its annual report that ""there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern"" (the company was ultimately restructured under bankruptcy protection.) On March 9, the CBOE Volatility Index ( VOLATILITYINDICES:^VIX ), or VIX, which is sometimes referred to as Wall Street's ""fear index,"" closed at 49.68 -- it has not closed above that since then.
What did we know then?
Instead of imminent doom, however, investors might have anticipated that, barring outright economic collapse, there was a decent chance that stocks would perform reasonably well over the next five years (though the market's actual performance has exceeded what one could have hoped for).
Why?
Valuations. On March 9, the S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, stood at just 11.9 -- cheaper than it had been at any point since 1986 (the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric popularized by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, compares stock prices to an average of inflation-adjusted earnings per share over a trailing-10-year period).
And so it was that the fear and revulsion that brought low risky assets in general, and equities in particular, set the foundations for a stunning bull market:
^GSPC data by YCharts
For the S&P 500 (blue line), which now boasts a 178% price return, a triple is almost in sight, if not immediately within reach. Note that the broad market, as represented by the Wilshire 5000 index (orange line) has done even better, thanks to the huge outperformance of small-capitalization stocks; the Russell 2000 (red line) has well more than tripled over the past five years. (Although the S&P 500 is the most widely used measure of the market's performance, it's technically a large-capitalization index.)
Where do we go now?
But where do those gains leave valuations today and what does that augur for returns over the next five years?
As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 now sports a corpulent CAPE of 25.6, going from a 27% discount to its long-term historical average five years ago, to its current 55% premium. That puts the CAPE into the highest 10% of its values over its entire history going back to 1881.
As hedge fund manager Cliff Asness observed in a November 2012 paper , historically, when the CAPE is within the top decile of its values, subsequent stock market returns are mediocre, with a 10-year real return that has averaged just 0.5% on an annualized basis (it's important to note, however, that the range of returns is very wide, varying from (6.3%) to +6.1%).
Last month, another well-regarded value investor, James Montier of GMO, published a white paper describing two methods to forecast real returns over the next seven years based on the CAPE. The more optimistic estimate called for an annualized return of just +0.8%, while the more pessimistic produced a (3.2%) loss! Those ought to be sobering figures, particularly for individual investors who have only now begun to drink directly from the equity market punchbowl.
With the prospect of such mediocre returns, should investors be selling their stocks instead of buying? My answer is ""no."" As my Foolish colleague Morgan Housel has highlighted, the CAPE isn't perfect (though I would argue it's the best metric we have) and even with a high starting CAPE value, the range of outcomes in terms of performance is very wide. As Cliff Asness points out:
I would, if trading on a tactical outlook, give the Shiller P/E some small weight, particularly when it's above 30 or below 10. But I think this type of analysis is most useful not for a trading strategy but to set reasonable expectations.
If you are a ""know-nothing"" investor (there is no shame in this -- it's the path almost every investor should adopt), the lesson is to temper one's expectations for future stock market returns -- the next five years are unlikely to mirror the past five and they could end up being very disappointing relative to stocks' historical average return (roughly 6.5% per annum, after inflation). Still, if you have an equity-appropriate time horizon, you can continue to put money into a low-cost index fund at regular intervals.
2 values in a heated market
If you have some skill, experience, and time -- and the inclination to pick individual stocks -- know that it's becoming increasingly difficult to ferret out names that trade at a discount to (or even at) their intrinsic value. However, there are still some values out there. Take the insurance sector, for example: MetLife ( NYSE:MET ), the No. 1 publicly traded life insurer in the U.S., is a wonderful franchise, yet it is valued at less than 9.5 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate -- a significant discount to the overall market. Viewed from another angle, it does not take much in the way of returns on equity to justify the stock's 21% premium to its tangible book value.
Another insurance-related name, Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK-B ), looks reasonably priced. In his recently released annual letter to shareholders, CEO Warren Buffett wrote that stock repurchases at 120% of book value ""benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value exceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount."" On Friday, Berkshire's shares closed at 136% of book value. My sense is that when Buffett refers to a ""meaningful amount,"" it's more than the difference by which 136 exceeds 120.
When it comes to individual stocks or the broad market, valuation has predictive value with regard to future performance. Right now, the U.S. stock market doesn't look particularly cheap, and while that tells us nothing about the market's direction in the near term, it's an anchor on performance over the medium to long term. Just as investors who extrapolated bear market losses into the future five years ago were wrong, those who extrapolate similar gains to those achieved over the past five years could well be making the same mistake today.

Huge 5-year fund returns? Don?t be misled
Many funds have more than doubled in the last five years, but that?s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.
Start the conversation >
Fabulous can have a flip side.
It?s something investors should remember as mutual funds? five-year return figures grow more eye-popping by the day. Many funds have more than doubled over that time, but that?s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the five-year anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.
That means the darkest days of the financial crisis are no longer counted in five-year returns, leaving only the recovery that sent the Standard & Poor?s 500 index to a record high.
The anniversary is a key milestone because many potential investors scrutinize a fund?s five-year record when deciding whether to buy a fund. It?s important, though, to put those stellar performance numbers in context and to temper expectations.
Market conditions are stacked against both stock and bond mutual funds having such strong returns over the next five years, analysts say. Plus, some of the funds with the best five-year returns led the pack because they focused on the riskiest investments. Many conservative managers, meanwhile, got left behind in the bull market.
To see how big the numbers are, check the performance of the largest mutual fund by assets. Vanguard?s Total Stock Market Index fund (VTSMX) has a five-year annualized return of 23.2 percent, according to Morningstar. At the end of 2012, its five-year annualized return was only 2.2 percent.
Investors already have some experience with this effect. Something similar happened with funds? three-year returns in early 2012.
A fund?s three- and five-year returns are typically the numbers that average investors find most important, says David Mertens, a principal at Jensen Investment Management. Its mutual funds include Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), which has Morningstar?s gold-medal analyst rating.
Mertens would prefer that investors give greater weight to a fund?s returns over 10 years or even longer. But ?people tend to buy what?s just happened,? he says. ?People buy yesterday?s story.?
Before you invest, here are some key considerations to put that story in perspective:
? A repeat performance is doubtful
Stocks are unlikely to rise as dramatically, in part because they don?t look as cheap as they did in 2009. One popular way to measure whether a stock is expensive is to divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share over the last 12 months.
Robert Shiller, a professor at Yale University and one of the winners of the Nobel Prize in economics last year, takes it a step further. He thinks it?s misleading to look at just one year because earnings can surge or drop in an economic cycle. To smooth out distortions, he looks at the S&P 500?s level versus its average earnings per share over the prior 10 years, adjusting for inflation.
By that measure, the S&P 500 in March 2009 was at its cheapest level in 23 years. Now, it?s nearly twice that level and back above its average since World War II. That suggests future gains for stocks won?t come from a further rise in price-earnings ratios as much as from growth in earnings.
This year, analysts forecast earnings per share for S&P 500 companies to rise 7.9 percent.
For bond funds, strategists are more pessimistic given expectations that interest rates will rise from their relatively low levels. Five years ago, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3 percent and on its way down. Falling interest rates help bond mutual funds because they push up prices for existing bonds.
Now, the 10-year Treasury?s yield is below 2.7 percent, but strategists say it?s on its way up. Many bond mutual funds in 2013 had their first down year in more than a decade amid rising interest rates.
? The last five years have rewarded risk
The top-performing stock fund over the last five years has been the Direxion Monthly NASDAQ-100 Bull 2x fund (DXQLX), which has a 60.7 percent annualized return. But it?s not what most people would consider a core investment. The fund is meant more for short-term traders than long-term investors.
It uses leverage in its attempt to double the monthly results of the Nasdaq 100 index, before fees and expenses. While that supercharges gains when the market is strong, it also accelerates losses during downturns. The fund lost 82.8 percent in 2008.
The reward for risk taking can also be seen among target-date mutual funds, which many savers depend on for their retirement accounts. These funds own mostly stocks when an investor?s retirement date is far off and automatically migrate toward bonds as the date nears. But some have less in stocks than others, even if they?re targeted at the same year of retirement.
The Wells Fargo Advantage Dow Jones Target 2025 fund, for example, is more conservative. That?s why it?s in the bottom 3 percent of its peer group for five-year returns. But in 2008, its greater emphasis on bonds helped to cushion the stock market?s losses, and it was in the category?s top 7 percent.
The good news is that investors don?t have to look back too far to see how a fund manager performed in a variety of markets, says David Lafferty, chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. It has $867.2 billion in assets under management.
Since the late ?90s, stocks have undergone three bull markets (the dot-com boom, the housing bubble and the most recent recovery for stocks) and two bear markets (the dot-com bust and the financial crisis).

Bull market still has some sizzle,http://www.cnbc.com/id/101476476,CNBC.com,"Friday,  7 Mar 2014 |  6:51  PM ET

Odds are against the stock market's aging bull making it through a sixth year, but this is no ordinary bull market.
Analysts expect stocks to continue running higher but at a slower pace than the 30 percent gain of last year.
It was five years ago this week that the S&P 500 plunged to an intraday low of 666, forcing capitulation of even the steadiest hands in a market panicking on fears that the financial sector was so ill it couldn't be cured.

Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Blue chips, like American Express and General Electric , were trading in the single digits. Since then, the S&P 500 has rebounded 177 percent to new highs, and the wounded financial sector is up more than 250 percent but still 60 percent off its 2007 high, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Fewer than a third of bull markets make it through a sixth year, but those that do have averaged gains of 26 percent in that year, says S&P Capital IQ. Monday marks the start of year six, and Wall Street strategists?nearly all expecting solid gains this year?say the economy will now have to prove that it is strong enough to keep corporate profits rising, as the Fed continues to pull back from its easy money policies.
""I think in a sense we're back to a more normal market environment,""  said Sam Stovall, chief strategist of S&P Capital IQ. Stovall, like others, says the market is particularly stretched since it has not had a major correction in months. ""I think we're bumping up against fair value for stocks, so unless we make some dramatic change to our economic and earnings growth expectations then I think we either have to correct in time or in price."" But he still targets the S&P reaching 1,940 by year-end.
(Read more: All clear on jobs front? Hmmm, maybe not so much )
While many analysts drew parallels during the financial crisis to the Great Depression and the market crash that preceded it, Stovall said the policy reactions were very different this time. ""What was different was the way the Fed responded to the financial crisis. What made me think this is not the 1930s/1940s is we got back to break even after five years. It took 25 years to get back to break even after the crash of 1929, and I think the bulk of that delay was the missteps of both the Fed and the Treasury.""
With the Fed stepping back  from its bond-buying program, stocks will have to navigate an environment of rising rates as long as economic growth improves as expected. Rates moved higher after Friday's jobs report reinforced the view that a recent batch of weak data is likely temporary and the result of bad winter weather. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.81 percent, a six-week high. There were 175,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February, the best pace since last year.

""We are paying most attention to the growth numbers. Typically over the last several years, the monetary policy picture has been a huge driver, and getting that right was a big part of being correct about making money in the market,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. ""We think that's fading to the back burner. The market's got QE fatigue. What the market really needs to see to continue the bull market is organic growth because the Fed said: 'we want to get out of this game.' ""
The market will also have to deal with more volatility, already impacting stocks this year since the Fed began pulling back from its quantitative easing program. Analysts, however, do not expect rates to rise so rapidly stocks will be jarred, and that's partly because the Fed has vowed to hold short-term rates lower for longer.
(Watch: Cashin says: Goldilocks jobs number )
""Our base case is we will see better performance of the market in the second half of the year because we do think better growth will come through. The stock market can handle higher rates as long as the economy is growing but if rates are rising because inflation is the cause, the market doesn't like that,"" McDonald said. ""The increases we have had in rates are because of better growth and a view the Fed is beginning to normalize policy, and we think that's good for the stock market.""
Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said the market should be able to handle the Fed's move away from QE. He expects the S&P to reach 1,975 to 2,025 this year. ""I think the economy has been healing, and I think there's a lot of room for growth, and if you look at things like consumer debt ratios, debt service to income is very low?the lowest level in 30 years. The last two times we were this low were the early stages of expansion in the early 1980s and early 1990s,"" he said. Thayer said the debt service to disposable income is down to 9.92 percent from 13.18 before the financial crisis and compared to 10.37 in the early 1990s.
(Read more: Americans borrow more but hit the plastic less )
""The bottom line is we still have the capacity to grow further if there aren't any major disruptions in the global economy. We think even though the market has done well in five years, there's a lot of room for further gains. It may not be smooth sailing every year, but we see more gains.""
Thayer said he sees that the biggest risks for U.S. stocks are likely to come from overseas, and he would put money first into U.S. stocks, then Japan and Europe, and lastly emerging markets.
McDonald said the situation with Ukraine should not impact stocks even if Crimea becomes part of Russia, but further aggression could change that view.
""What would cause the bull market to end? There's two possibilities. One is the economy runs out of gas and investors say: 'There's no more monetary support. We're going to take money off the table,' "" he said. ""The second is the economy gets so strong that the Fed has to raise interest rates and you have a typical end of the bull market."" But McDonald said he is still constructive on stocks though he said the idea that the economy gets weaker is the scenario he sees as more likely at some point in the next couple of years.
""We have gone over 600 days without a 10 percent correction. Typically on average, you have a 10 percent correction every 161 days. 1,250 days without a 20 percent correction. We typically have one every 635 days. The market is extended,"" said McDonald. ""Those periods tend to be more extended during bull cycles. It is not unusual to have longer cycles when the market is going up, and that 's what we experienced, but it's telling you this rally is long in the tooth.""

The S&P 500 closed up just about 1 percent this past week, at 1,878. Events in Ukraine first sent stocks spiraling lower Monday before swinging to record highs later in the week. The Dow was up 0.8 percent for the week, at 16,452, and the Nasdaq was up 0.6 percent at 4,336. The Dow is still more than 100 points away from its all-time high.
In the coming week, traders said Treasurys could continue to trade lower, with yields rising, ahead of $64 billion in auctions for three- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds Tuesday through Thursday.
Key data in the week ahead includes retail sales on Thursday.
Perhaps one of the biggest events of the week will be the confirmation hearing for Stanley Fischer as Fed vice chair. The hearing also includes the renomination of Jerome Powell as Fed governor, and the nomination of Lael Brainard as a member of the board.

The stock market crash this week  that occurred five years ago this Sunday marks a solemn anniversary for U.S.  stock markets.
Subprime financial crisis-related  events would ultimately become responsible for five out  of the top ten biggest single-day Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market crashes ,  including the top two spots.
After the Dow Jones hit an (at  the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more  than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 ? a little under 18 months later.
U.S. markets hit their lowest  point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point  is this Sunday.
Since that day, U.S. markets have  skyrocketed. The S&P  500 Index is up  174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones  Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and  the Nasdaq is up  235% (3,040.5).
Note: Turn market  volatility into profits by learning to trade the market's most powerful index. Here's how?
In fact, as of this week, the  bull market ? defined as a period in which the S&P 500 gains 20% or more ? ranks as the sixth longest since 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group  research.
However, the longer this rally  lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least  an official stock market correction ? defined as a decline of 10% or more.
""I am very concerned about a  correction right now,"" Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith  Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. ""The past few weeks have seen higher prices and  lower volume. This is like climbing a mountain into thin air ? every step  higher gets harder. Sooner or later, the markets are going to have to take a breather  and turn around.""
Here are the three signs that have investors worried we're due for a  stock market crash or correction soon?

S&P 500 rebound from March 2009 lows joins small club of five-year-plus surges
By
WallaceWitkowski
Reporter
SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) ? U.S. stocks enter their sixth year of a bull market this Monday, joining a rare group of multi-year stock surges that can support early retirements, pay off college debt, and make pension funds whole.
Or not. The fifth year of the last bull market ended spectacularly and painfully for investors in October 2007, leaving many so scarred they avoided stocks years into this latest rebound.
The good news: The few cycles that make it past their fifth birthday keep motoring along, churning out as much as a decade of gains. Momentum is your friend: On average, the sixth year has produced 26% growth.
The bad: There's plenty that?s different this time around, starting with the Federal Reserve?s full-throttle bond buys to flatten yields. The S&P 500 already produced an eye-popping 30% gain last year. The economy needs to get back its mojo ? the 3% growth rate that?s been elusive since 2005.
?What ended nearly every [bull market] was a recession, so we need continued economic growth,? said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
The almost five-year-old bull market started on March 10, 2009, when the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.17% ?and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.13% ?both rebounded 6% in one day off their respective multi-year lows reached March 9 . At the low, the S&P 500 closed at a bottom of 676.53, a drop of nearly 57% from its October 2007 highs. The Dow closed at 6,547.05. Since then, the S&P 500 has climbed 177% and the Dow has gained 151%.
Group of three
Concern that days are numbered for the current bull market are not unfounded. A minority of bull markets since 1945 have made it to their sixth birthday.
P/E ratios are back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007.
Including the current bull market, there have been 12 since the end of World War II. Of those, only half of them made it to a fifth birthday, according to Sam Stovall, chief equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, in a recent note.
After that, the list gets halved again for those making it to a sixth birthday. Those bull markets include the 7-year bull market that ended in August 1956, the 6-year bull market that ended in November 1980, and the nearly 10-year-old bull market that ended in March 2000. Those go-go days of the 1990s bull market, which ended in the Internet bust, fattened nest eggs with an S&P 500 gain of over 400%.
The history is tantalizing, particularly for investors still repairing the damage from the last bear market and a concurrent housing market collapse.
Here?s what this bull market needs to do to make it to its sixth birthday, says Stovall:
U.S. economic growth needs to ramp up and reach 3% by the end of 2014 supported by gains in auto sales and housing.
Earnings per share growth needs to increase in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014 coupled with gains in revenue. Stovall expects an 8% advance in EPS with revenue rising 3.7%.
Congress needs to indicate that it is working toward meaningful tax reform legislation by 2015 to help spur increased capital expenditures and repatriation of foreign earnings.
Valuations based on price-to-earnings ratios remain supportive.
That last part can be troubling given concerns that stock prices have grown faster than their supporting earnings. Stovall said that while the trailing 12-month P/E is above average since 1947, it?s actually below the average when the consumer price index has been in the 1.5% to 2.5% range.
For the economy, a 3% growth rate for the U.S. isn?t a slam dunk. The U.S. economy hasn?t grown 3% or more in nine years. A recent revision of fourth-quarter GDP figures showed the economy growing at 2.4% , down from a previous figure of 3.2%.
Read: Is the White House?s 3.1% growth forecast still too rosy?
In this aging bull?s favor, it?s still cheap to borrow to buy and build. The yield on the 10-year Treasury US:10_YEAR ?note is in the 2.7% range ? in contrast to 4.65% at the end of the last bull market in October 2007.
Stocks are ?shackled to earnings growth?
Back in March 2009, P/E ratios for stocks in the S&P 500 had fallen below 11x . Now, they?re back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007. That means that earnings growth has become even more crucial to cool off those multiples.

By Tom Hals
Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.
Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.
The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.
""This case involves a massive fraud,"" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. ""They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.""
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.
""We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,"" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.
Mt. Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.
Hale's order protects Mt. Gox's U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.
Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.
Mt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.
The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company's true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.
Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means ""worthless little symbol"" in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.
It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.
Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.
When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.
He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.
Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.
The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.
The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver's license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.
The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

Hackers Claim Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles Held 'Stolen' Customer Bitcoins,http://www.designntrend.com/articles/11510/20140310/hackers-strike-again-claiming-mt-gox-ceo-mark-karpeles-held-customer-bitcoins.htm,Design \& Trend,"Close
(Photo : Reuters/Jim Urquhart) Every MIT undergrad will receive $100 of the digital currency this semester.
Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of Mt. Gox, one of the world's most popular bitcoin exchanges, which is now bankrupt.
The company initially announced that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins, 750,000 of which belonged to investors and users. It is estimated that the number balances out to $480 million.
The attackers are claiming that, along with the 750,000 customer bitcoins, 100,000 of the company's own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits are missing, PC World reported .
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy last month after the exchange mysteriously went offline, stopping cryptocurrency trades, according to PC Magazine .
""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin community's wrath instead of the bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" the unnamed group wrote, referring to Mt. Gox's downtime and other glitches.
According to PC Magazine , the hackers posted a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers to the French CEO's website, including a spreadsheet of over a million trades, 18 currencies of the company's balance (in addition to bitcoin), access to Tibanne Limited (Gox's parent company), and a screenshot of the hackers' access. Karpeles's home address and personal resume were also listed.
""This release would have been sooner, but in the spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the date,"" the hackers wrote, telling readers to ""repost and share this info before it's gond.""
The initial post on Reddit was deleted, and Kerpeles's website is currently down.
Mt. Gox has blamed a security issue called transaction malleability, which lets hackers manipulate transaction identification numbers, so they can steal bitcoins, PC World reports .

Mt. Gox Files For US Chapter 15 Bankruptcy,http://www.benzinga.com/news/14/03/4378204/mt-gox-files-for-u-s-chapter-15-bankruptcy,Benzinga,"March 10, 2014 12:55pm ? Comments

Mt. Gox is well-known for creating one of the world's first Bitcoin trading posts. Unfortunately, in the company's most recent attempt to save its legacy, the virtual company has had to file for bankruptcy to protect its remaining assets, while trying to expand internationally.
Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is special because it often deals with cases and scenarios that are related to other countries as well. The goal of this proceeding is to combine efforts to come to a mutual agreement.
The Japanese company first filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, back in Tokyo, Japan. Filing in the U.S. enables the virtual currency company to use the U.S. court systems which would help solve the company's case faster and much more efficiently.

CEO Mark Karpeles is blaming cyber attacks and theft for the loss of monetary gain and has even stated that it can go bankrupt at any point in time. ""For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that 'transaction malleability' caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it.""
Karpeles continued, ""Gox's own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.
""The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.""
Even though all signs point to a bankrupt company, the Bitcoin industry has flourished in general and some signs have even pointed to new ATMs being created to function with Bitcoin currency.

Furious about your Mt. Gox losses??You?ll have to cool your heels.
U.S. legal actions against Mt. Gox ? notably a lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court that sought class-action status ? are on temporary hold after the bitcoin exchange submitted a bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday.
Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection, designed for cases where the parties are based in multiple countries. The Tokyo company, once the world?s largest bitcoin trading post, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28 .
At the time it said ?750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox bitcoins were missing, meaning a cool $450 million had gone up in smoke.
The U.S. bankruptcy eventually could benefit stranded investors, giving the U.S. a structure to work with other countries to track down any remaining assets.
Over the weekend, furious bitcoin users hacked the website of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles , posting data that appears to show that the exchange still holds customer investments in the millions of dollars.
?It?s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities? wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,? an anonymous hacker wrote.
So on the downside, Mt. Gox has imploded. On the upside, it?s vaulted into the echelons of companies whose names became common verbs. Of course, being synonymous with total flakiness is not something most CEOs aspire to.
Believe it or not, getting ?goxed? first showed up in Urban Dictionary almost three years ago after a spate of Mt. Gox closures and trading delays, but it?s caught fire in the past couple of weeks.

Report: Mt. Gox CEO Holding 'Stolen' Bitcoins,"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2454756,00.asp",PC Magazine,"VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY
Hackers this weekend targeted the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the bankrupt Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, posting information online that they claim proves Karpeles is actually hoarding bitcoins he claims were stolen.
The hackers charge that some of the nearly half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency lost in recent cyberattacks is actually still in the French CEO's possession.
""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" the unnamed group wrote, according to Forbes , a reference to the downtime and other glitches that have plagued Mt. Gox.
The hackers initially posted to Karpeles's website a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers; it included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, the company's balance in 18 currencies (including bitcoin), administrative access to Gox parent company Tibanne Limited, and a screenshot of the hackers' access, as well as a list of Karpeles's home addresses and personal resume.
An abridged version, which features Mt. Gox's balances, was later posted online , with a link to the entire set of data.

""This release would have been sooner, but in the spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data,"" the hackers wrote on Pastebin, advising readers to ""repost and share this info before it's gone.""
Karpeles's website is currently offline , and the original Reddit post has since been deleted.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan late last month, saying it lost 750,000 bitcoins, or about $480 million?7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. An attack on the company's computer systems also cost Gox about 100,000 of its own units.
The filing came days after the exchange mysteriously went offline, halting trades of the cryptocurrency.
Last month, meanwhile, bitcoins valued at approximately $2.7 million went missing from Silk Road 2, allegedly due to a hack. Silk Road 2 is the reincarnation of the original Silk Road, an online black market for all things criminal that was shut down by the feds last year. The new site emerged in November and is only accessible to those who have an invite and sign in using the Tor anonymizing service.
Bitcoin has been a popular topic of late. Last week, Newsweek said it had uncovered the creator of bitcoin , a 64-year-old California man named Satoshi Nakamoto. But has denied any involvement .

Who?s ?Goxing? who now? Vitriolic hackers hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles?s personal blog, Tumblr and Reddit accounts yesterday, hurling accusations that head of the defunct exchange is sitting on the missing $500 million-plus bitcoins he says cyber attackers stole.
The anonymous hackers leaked data allegedly proving that customer bitcoins are not lost after all and that some 951,116 BTC might still exist and Karpeles is still in control of them.
Meanwhile, CoinDesk warns that the leaked .exe and .app files ?are bitcoin wallet-stealing trojans.? The issuer of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index strongly cautions against opening the files and advises anyone who already has to ?transfer your bitcoins to another wallet immediately.?

Mt. Gox has not yet officially commented on the hacker attacks, but a spam warning titled ?scam alert notification? appeared on its website last night.
The 700-plus MB data dump ?evidence,? which consists of a large zip file called ?MtGox2014Leak.zip,? was posted on Karpeles? now offline MagicalTux.net blog and microblogging accounts.
Not long after the leak, which might have come from disgruntled former Mt. Gox employees, individuals claiming to be Mt. Gox customers took to Twitter to say that they opened the zip file and were able to confirm their own account balances based on their user Mt. Gox IDs issued in their initial Mt.

Someone also posted an Excel spreadsheet mirror of based on the leaked data with accounts and balances stripped of identifying user information.

One leaked document appears to have exposed two of Karpeles? residential street addresses.
The Bitcoin community continues to debate the validity of the allegedly stolen files.

By Tom Hals
March 10 Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.
Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.
The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.
""This case involves a massive fraud,"" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. ""They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.""
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.
""We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,"" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.
Mt. Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.
Hale's order protects Mt. Gox's U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.
Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.
Mt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.
The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company's true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.
Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means ""worthless little symbol"" in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.
It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.
Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.
When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.
He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.
Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.
The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.
The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver's license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.
Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.
A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox's request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets.
Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.
Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.
In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.
Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.
Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.

Mt. Gox Files for Chapter 15 Bankruptcy Protection in US,http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mt-gox-files-chapter-15-bankruptcy-protection-us-1439688,International Business Times UK,"March 10, 2014 17:05 GMT
Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles announces the request for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo last month.Reuters
The Japanese-based bitcoin exchange has filed bankruptcy papers in the US following a similar move in Japan last month.
On Sunday, Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US having filed a similar application in Japan on 28 February. The particular chapter of bankruptcy protection sought deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.
The move is just the latest move in the unfolding story of what was once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, handling up to 80% of all trades at one point in 2013.
On 28 February the exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo claiming that 850,000 bitcoins (at the time worth around ?240 million) had been stolen from the exchange, 100,000 which belonged to the company and 750,000 belonging to the customers.
Chapter 15 protection in the US was introduced back in 1997 and is almost entirely based on the UN Model Law which aims to modernise and harmonise cross-border insolvencies around the world.
Some relief
If granted it would provide some relief for Mt. Gox, including the granting of an ""automatic stay"" preventing creditors seizing its US assets.
A company files for bankruptcy protection if it believes it can recover financially, given time and some amount of restructuring and reorganisation - this could include a change of management, business model or the selling of a highly-value assets such as buildings (which could be leased back from the buyer) or vehicles.
When a company files for bankruptcy outright, it has accepted that it is no longer able to repay its creditors and any steps for recovery are impossible.
The latest move in Mt. Gox's story comes after hackers claim to have stolen transaction logs from the exchange which they published on Karpeles' personal blog over the weekend. The hackers claim the under-fire CEO was lying about the amount of bitcoins the exchange had leading to many users of Mt. Gox to claim Karpeles had stolen their bitcoins.

Anonymous hackers claim MtGox still has 'stolen' Bitcoins,http://www.scmagazineuk.com/anonymous-hackers-claim-mtgox-still-has-stolen-bitcoins/article/337507/,SC Magazine UK,"March 10, 2014
Anonymous hackers claim MtGox still has 'stolen' Bitcoins
The bad news keeps getting worse for MtGox. Two weeks on from being forced to close after hackers stole approximately 850,000 Bitcoins (BTC), the currency exchange now faces accusations that it is still holding onto some of the 'stolen' Bitcoins.
Bitcoin exchanges hit by malformed code DDoS attacks
Forbes reports that anonymous hackers took over community website Reddit, as well as the personal blog of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles, on Sunday to allege that Karpeles had actually retained some of the Bitcoins that the company said had been stolen from its users.
The blog post has since been removed, although the message can be viewed on Pastebin .
""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.""
The 716MB file dumps appears to include personal data ? including Karpeles' home address and resume, as well as a purported screenshot of MtGox's Bitcoin balance.
Hackers say that this ledger shows that the trading exchange still has a current balance of 951,116 BTC which would ? if true ? mean that customer Bitcoins have not been lost, but rather that fraud has been committed. MtGox filed for Japanese bankruptcy on 28 February and claimed at the time that it had lost around 850,000 Bitcoins , including 100,000 of its own, as well as approximately ?16.41 million (US$ 27.3 million) in customer deposits.
Forbes writer Andy Greenberg points out that it is possible that this could simply be a case of accounting mismatches, with the exchange counting Bitcoins as being safe even when they had already been stolen. However, it is worth noting that since MtGox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions ? the Bitcoin blockchain (which tracks the movement of currency, while ensuring that the users are anonymous) ? has not registered any movement of the ?stolen? virtual coins.
?I couldn't verify that Sunday's database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how MtGox's accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins?that it was counting Bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves,? said Greenberg.
In related news, MtGox recently issued a press release to say that phishing campaigns have been making the rounds. Hackers have used MtGox's identity and been asking for the name, address, username, password and bank account numbers of those who have lost virtual currency.
Karpeles and other MtGox officials couldn't be reached for comment on this story.

Mt. Gox files for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S.

Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on Sunday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S., more than a week after it filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed that it had lost about 750,000 of its customers\? bitcoins.
Bloomberg News
Mark Karpeles, chief executive of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.
Chapter 15 is a chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code that facilitates insolvency cases involving parties in more than one country. Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 in Dallas and is being represented by Baker & McKenzie, which is also the law firm representing Mt. Gox its civil rehabilitation proceeding in Japan.
\?There may be Mt. Gox assets and?liabilities?in the U.S. ? clearly there is at least one lawsuit that we?re already aware of ? and to the extent bitcoins with a relationship to Mt. Gox are?accessible?in the U.S., Mt. Gox wants to invoke the bankruptcy automatic stay,\? said Ira Herman, a partner at Thompson & Knight in New York.
\?The automatic stay will serve to halt attempts including litigation to recover against Mt. Gox or to seize Mt. Gox\?s assets,\? said Herman, adding that the stay doesn\?t apply until a recognition order is entered.
Mt. Gox\?s Chapter 15 filing showed it is seeking relief from two parties in the U.S. with pending litigation: CoinLab Inc. and Gregory Greene, a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit who alleges he lost $25,000 worth of bitcoin. The? class-action lawsuit ?was filed against Mt. Gox and Chief Executive Mark Karpeles on Feb. 28 in Illinois on behalf of all people in the U.S. who held bitcoins in the exchange by the law firm Edelson PC. The lawsuit seeks the return of the customers\? funds and damages against Mt. Gox and Karpeles.
There is an emergency hearing scheduled for Monday in Texas on Mt. Gox\?s filing, according to Christopher Dore, a partner at Edelson who is working on the case. He refused to comment until after the hearing.
Mt. Gox\?s? application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange\?s liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins. The Japanese proceeding, which is similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S., noted the possibility of letting Mt. Gox continue business operations \?in order to increase repayments to our creditors.\?
The bankruptcy filing in Japan came after Mt. Gox abruptly shuttered its website, leaving users unable to trade or access the bitcoins stored in the exchange, and followed days of halts on bitcoin withdrawals.
\?Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community,\? the application for civil rehabilitation in Japan said.

TOKYO, March 10 (UPI) -- Anonymous hackers published what they claim is evidence of fraud conducted by Japan-based bitcoin trader Mt. Gox and the virtual money isn't missing.
Mt. Gox closed last month, claiming cybercriminals stole about 850,000 in bitcoin cybercurrency, worth more than $500 million, over several years.  At the time, Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said bitcoins were lost ""due to weaknesses in the system,"" and Mt. Gox since filed for bankruptcy in Japan.
During the weekend, however, anonymous hackers said they hacked into the trading post and accessed Mt. Gox data, ZDNet reported Monday. After taking over Karpeles' blog and an account during the weekend, the group that hacked into the system posted:
""It's time that Mt. Gox got the bitcoin communities' wrath instead of bitcoin community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data. ... Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data.""
The post said ""lots of people, including us,"" lost money and bitcoin currency, techCrunch said.
""We stole no bitcoins,"" the hackers posted. ""There were none to steal.""
Within the summary, the hackers claim Mt. Gox's current balance is 951,116 bitcoin currency, which if factual, means that customers' bitcoin wasn't lost, indicating fraud was committed.
Forbes magazine reported the 716-megabyte file dump appears to include personal data, a spreadsheet documenting more than 1 million trades, Mt. Gox's bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers' access to the information.
In a release, Mt. Gox said phishing campaigns have begun against it.

By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.
Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.
The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.
""This case involves a massive fraud,"" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. ""They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.""
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing. ? Continued...

Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.
Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.

Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.
Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.
In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.
Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.
Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox files for bankruptcy in the US,http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/10/mt-gox-us-bankruptcy/,Engadget,"Share

Just days after it sought protection in Japan , once popular Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the US in the hope of climbing out of the huge hole it's found itself in. Still reeling from the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins (currently worth around $549 million) and debts of more than $63.6 million, the company has filed papers that will temporarily suspend US legal action against it , allowing it to work out how ""weaknesses in the system"" allowed the digital currency to go missing in the first place. It's not quite the news customers were hoping for, but it's a logical move by Mt. Gox as it will better protect investors located outside of Japan and could also open avenues for it to take on financial aid. While it continues to piece together exactly what happened, some are taking matters into their own hands. Over the weekend, hackers reportedly gained access to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, accusing the company of fraud and alleging it kept some of the Bitcoins that had been reported stolen.

Hackers claim bankrupt Mt. Gox still has customers' Bitcoins,http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/10/5489582/mt-gox-hackers-say-exchange-still-has-customers-bitcoins,The Verge,"Linkedin
Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox lost? $400 million worth of bitcoins in February . Its management said the amount was stolen after hackers exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, but some of Mt. Gox's users are not so sure, suggesting instead? that the exchange's owners pocketed the cash . Now, facing silence from those owners about the fate of the money and the methods by which 6 percent of all of the Bitcoin in the world could have been stolen, a group of hackers claims it has broken into the bankrupted Bitcoin exchange's network to get answers.
Forbes reports that the group gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO. The hackers used the platforms to post a message that claimed Karpeles still had access to some of the bitcoins that he'd reported stolen. In support of the claim, they uploaded a series of files that included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, Karpeles' home addresses, and a screenshot purportedly confirming the hackers' access to the data.
The hackers claim that Mt. Gox still has access to 951,116 bitcoins
Also included as part of the 716MB file was a file that appears to show the exchange's balances in 18 currencies. The hackers point to this file ? which reportedly shows a balance of 951,116 bitcoins ? as evidence that Mt. Gox is misrepresenting the current situation. A note in the file from the hackers reportedly reads ""That fat fuck has been lying!!""
The files could simply show poor accounting practices
Forbes says the veracity of the file has yet to be confirmed. It could simply highlight the kind of poor accounting practices that allowed hackers to steal the money in the first place, showing money in Mt. Gox's balances that has long since made its way to hacker hands; or it could be evidence to support the theory that the company used the cover of a transaction exploit to steal its customers' money. The exchange? claimed it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins in its bankruptcy protection filing ? in addition to 100,000 of its own bitcoins ? but users of the cryptocurrency are yet to see that money appear on the log of public Bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain. That would suggest whoever does have the money isn't spending it at the moment.
Forbes suggests the hack may be related to another supposed breach in which a user on BitcoinTalk's forums offered a 20GB file that they said was also stolen from Mt. Gox. The user claims the file is full of Mt. Gox users' personal details and passport scans, and that they were planning to sell it for 100 bitcoins ""one or two times to make up personal losses from Mt. Gox closure.""

Steven Church
Mt. Gox Co., the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo after millions of dollars? worth of virtual currency vanished from customer accounts, won a temporary halt to lawsuits it faces in the U.S.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas today agreed to shield the company?s assets from creditors and halt two suits, both of which are in their early stages. The company will return to court April 1 to seek to extend the protection until the Japanese case is resolved.
The Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after losing Bitcoins worth about $473 million at the time. The company said in its U.S. filing that almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own, about 7 percent of all Bitcoins in existence worldwide, were missing and probably stolen.
?The facts known to date indicate that it was caused or related to a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, and ?hacking? attacks of one or more persons,? Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said in a sworn statement filed in the Dallas court.
The exchange was founded in 2011, two years after Bitcoins first appeared. Shortly after it opened in July of that year, hackers attempted to break into the system or shut it down with so-called denial of service attacks, according to court papers.
Federal Probe
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown of Mt. Gox, two people familiar with the matter said last month. The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital currency, said last month that it briefed federal prosecutors about possible theft at Mt. Gox.
A spokeswoman for Bharara, Jennifer Queliz, today declined to comment on whether a software flaw would effect a federal investigation, citing the office?s policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.
Last month, Mt. Gox was sued in federal court in Chicago by an Illinois resident accusing it of misappropriation and fraud. The company also faces a $75 million breach-of-contract suit filed by CoinLab Inc. in Washington state.
Mt. Gox filed for creditor protection yesterday in federal court in Dallas under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which can be used to shield assets while the main bankruptcy proceeding is carried out in another country. The petition listed about $37.7 million in assets and $63.9 million in liabilities.
Jed MacCaleb, who built the initial Mt. Gox software, owns 12 percent of the company. Tibanne Co., a Japanese company, owns the rest, according to court documents.
The U.S. bankruptcy is In re MtGox Co., 14-bk-31229, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The Illinois lawsuit is Greene v. Mt. Gox Inc., 14-cv-01437, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).

The Japan-based company filed for bankruptcy in a Dallas court, according to Reuters . By seeking bankruptcy, it hopes to avoid extensive legal costs stemming from a class-action suit filed against the company in Chicago.

Two weeks after Mt. Gox, once the world's highest-volume Bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy, angry currency traders are questioning the company's claim that it sank because of a theft.
They're also contesting the numbers that former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles logged in the exchange's ledger at the time it shuttered.
On Sunday, hackers broke into Karpeles' now-erased now-defunct blog to find the exchange's balance sheets, which, the hackers say, suggest that Karpeles fleeced his clientele. In a profanity-sluiced screed that quickly made the rounds on Reddit and other social networks, the hackers accused Karpeles of squirreling away Bitcoins he'd reported stolen.
To bolster that point, they posted tables detailing all the currency in Mt. Gox's reserves, including 951,116.21905382 in Bitcoin -- more than Karpeles claimed were in the company's coffers.  The hackers also published links to a zip file that allows anyone to download all of Karpeles' blog posts.
According to the post -- which was removed, along with Karpeles' blog --  this file includes ""relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,"" -- all of which appear to be part of Gox's internal accounting system.
Now they'll be deployed as swords against the disgraced CEO.
""It's time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin communities [SIC] wrath instead of Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" the cached post says. It quickly snowballed on Reddit, where users converted the zip dump into a bit torrent file, lest the original be deleted.
The hackers say they would have made this leak sooner, but, in the interest of ""responsible disclosure,"" wanted to wait and verify all the data. Nonetheless, its authenticity is still open for scrutiny.
Meanwhile, fortune hasn't turned for the insolvent Tokyo-based exchange, whose proprietors just filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US. The company's travails created havoc for Bitcoin, but not quite enough to shake the faith of local enthusiasts like QuickCoin founder Marshall Hayner, who says he had some money invested in Gox.
He hopes the fiasco will induce regulators to tighten up security for Bitcoin.

Now it looks like Mt. Gox may have been hacked again, although according to a recent report, what was taken from the exchange this time was data.
According to Forbes, the hackers who carried out the latest attack on Mt. Gox are accusing the company of fraud, and have alleged that MT. Gox actually kept some of the Bitcoins that were previously reported as stolen.
The hackers have said that they have found a balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they claim are owned by Mt. Gox, and these Bitcoins were apparently reported as stolen in the previous Hack.
They also published personal details, including the home address of the Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, there has been no comment from anyone from Mt. Gox as yet regarding the allegations.

Hackers have stolen account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.
The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.
The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called ""Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!"" and posted the stolen information there.
The information was contained in a 716 megabyte file which includes an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades as well as an internal SQl database administration tool and even Karpeles' own CV.
A note on the file add: ""That fat f**k has been lying!!"" The hackers also took over the Reddit account of Karpeles and posted the information there too. Reddit moderators have since removed the post, which said: ""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed.""
Scam exposed
Despite the removal of the post, users of the bitcoin subreddit have made their position very clear, with one of the top posts on the forum saying:
""Mt. Gox scam was just exposed ? MK [Mark Karpeles] officially stole our funds.""
Karpeles has so far not responded to the claims.
The hackers added that the bitcoin community could use the relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialised tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data from the given download link to help expose what really went on at Mt. Gox.
The hackers have redacted any user details from the files.

Collapsed
Last month Japan-based MtGox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to a hack - 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Two weeks ago, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan.
The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, ?38m, ?46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.
The Tokyo-based company was the largest and most well-known bitcoin exchange in the world when the cryptocurrency shot to fame last year.
The exchange claims that problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins than were being recorded by the exchange.
Known as "" transaction malleability "", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.
The exchange's collapse led to the price of bitcoin crashing but the virtual currency has shown remarkable resilience and the price of the cryptocurrency has bounced back and is currently trading at ?381 on the Coindesk index.

Over the weekend, hackers stole the database of the failed Bitcoin exchange MtGox , hijacked the blog and Reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles ? and published the former via the latter. The data appears to show that MtGox did not have all its bitcoins cleaned out by hackers, as it claimed when it went bankrupt.
?Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,? the hackers wrote in the document they published. No user data was included, but some of those ?specialized tools? linked to in the document turned out to be Bitcoin wallet-stealing malware (taken down by the host, once Redditors notified it.)

If you can?t trust an angry cryptocurrency-fanatic hacker to dump a risk-free executable file into the wild, who can you trust?
Sarcasm aside, the leaked information appears to bolster the case of those who suspect Karpeles of defrauding his customers. The way Karpeles and his lawyers told it, hackers had stolen 750,000 bitcoins belonging to MtGox?s customers and 100,000 belonging to the exchange itself, supposedly leaving nothing.
According to the data leaked on the weekend, MtGox actually still has 951,116 bitcoins. This detail is accompanied in the document by a strongly-worded suggestion that Karpeles has been less than honest. One bitcoin is currently worth around $620, so that would be roughly $590 million worth.
That said, by MtGox?s version of events, the exchange only recently noticed that the 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen a long time ? perhaps even years ? ago. There?s no evidence that the outfit ever conducted a proper audit of what it did and didn?t actually hold, so the possibility remains that the information leaked over the weekend is just plain wrong.
Either way, that?s not even the end of the risky business floating around the MtGox collapse. The exchange also put out a notice on Saturday, warning that its former users were being targeted by spam/phishing emails, dressed up to look like MtGox emails and asking for MtGox and bank account details.
?We highly recommend not to respond to these emails,? MtGox said in the notice. That much, certainly, is true.

Mt. Gox recently filed for bankruptcy after the company said that they had been hacked and over $400 million worth of Bitcoins had been stolen.
We heard a report earlier today that MT. Gox was hacked recently, and the hackers who carrier out the attack obtained data from Mt. Gox.
The hackers alleged that Mt. Gox are still in possession of the Bitcoins that the company previously reported as stolen, Mt. Gox has neither confirmed of denied this.
Now ZDNet has discovered that Mt. Gox has also filed for bankruptcy in the US, the company previously filed for bankruptcy in Japan.
According to the ZDNet report, the company filed chapter 15 bankruptcy in the US yesterday, this is the second country that the company has made this filing in.
From what has been revealed so far, it looks like there may be a little more to the story of Mt. Gox than originally thought, as soon as we get some more information on exactly what happened, we will let you guys know.

(Newser) ?                                         Hackers say the now-bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been less than honest about money lost in a major security lapse . Yesterday, they hacked into CEO Mark Karpeles' blog and Reddit account, announcing that the company had kept currency it claimed was stolen, Forbes reports. They said they'd hacked Mt. Gox's servers, and posted a file full of data suggesting the exchange had a balance of 951,116 bitcoins. Hackers say that points to fraud after the company claimed it lost 750,000 of users' bitcoins.
The authenticity of the document isn't entirely clear, though some Reddit posters noted that personal account information revealed in the file appeared accurate, CNET notes. Still, it's possible that the balance shows money that was already lost in the security breach, reflecting bad accounting rather than theft, the Verge reports. Meanwhile, a bitcoin forum user said he or she was trying to sell 20 gigabytes of stolen information from Mt. Gox?a database that holds user details, including passport scans. ""Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses (sic) from gox closure,"" the user said. The price: 100 bitcoins, or some $63,000, Forbes notes.

Mt. Gox files for US bankruptcy amid new hacker claims,http://www.slashgear.com/mt-gox-files-for-us-bankruptcy-amid-new-hacker-claims-10320114/,SlashGear,"Reddit
Hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US, having already filed in Japan last month, and seen its CEO?s blog vandalized with claims of exactly how much of investors? virtual cash was lost . The bankruptcy filing, on Sunday, March 9th, follows revelations by Mt. Gox that hackers broke into its digital vaults and drained them, leaving the Japanese company $63.6m in debt.
The Japanese bankruptcy filing was made on February 28th, MarketWatch reports, but now has been extended to a US filing under Chapter 15. That?s the part of the bankruptcy process which facilitates representatives of non-US companies from accessing the US legal system, such as when assets in the US are at stake.
Whether that will mean US investors who had their bitcoins holdings stored with Mt. Gox will ever see any of their money back is unclear at this stage.
Also unclear is just how much was stolen. Mt. Gox originally declared 744,408 bitcoins had been taken, but documents acquired by hackers over the weekend claim the figure is more like 951,116. The alleged numbers ? as well as other details ? were posted to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles? own blog.
?We stole no bitcoins? the hackers added. ?There were none to steal.?

Firm files in US for Chap 15 bankruptcy as creditors gather
10 Mar 2014 at 14:22, Jasper Hamill
Hackers have released what they claim are genuine documents which they say prove the stricken exchange still controls almost a million Bitcoins.
As Bitcoin exchange MtGox was filing for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday, a group of hackers took over MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog , which has since been taken down, and posted a 716MB file they claimed they had snatched from MtGox's servers.
Although the document's veracity cannot be confirmed, it suggested the exchange was still in possession of 951,116 Bitcoins.
MtGox's US bankruptcy case was filed under Chapter 15, which is used to handle bankruptcy cases where parties are based in more than one country. This comes two weeks after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan.
?It?s time that MtGox got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,? the hackers wrote .
However, even if the leaked docs are genuine, it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing. It is still unclear what exactly happened to MtGox that caused it to file for bankruptcy protection . It may be that its systems still show a huge balance even though the Bitcoins have all disappeared, because any theft may not been properly recorded.
MtGox also released a statement (PDF) warning former users of a number of phishing attacks that may be directed at them.
Meanwhile, Dorian Nakamoto, the man Newsweek controversially accused of being the inventor of Bitcoin, has kept a dignified silence whilst the world frantically debates whether or not he was wrongly identified as the creator of the cryptocurrency.
Someone claiming to be Dorian's brother Arthur Nakamoto ? who was supposedly quoted in the Newsweek article ? took to Reddit and issued various bizarre statements about the alleged Bitcoin brainbox.
""Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exist today,"" the other supposed Nakamoto wrote. ""I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.""
He added: ""I understand that I will be mis-quoted and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. What I wanted to do is to plead to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. What's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is that I cannot physically go to to see him and my mother to be of family support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger."" ?

Mt. Gox files for bankruptcy in U.S.
The Japan-based Bitcoin exchange files Chapter 15 bankruptcy paperwork in the U.S. in efforts to protect its remaining assets, while opening up international channels of co-operation.
| Topic: Tech Industry
Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.
The once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday . This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.
On 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.

As Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.
The Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for? Japanese bankruptcy protection ?(.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.
Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss --? taking place over several years ?-- was due to ""weaknesses in the system"" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.
Over the weekend , anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt. Gox systems and lifted apparent evidence that customer investments were not the target of theft, but instead are still being held at the exchange as part of a fraudulent plot by Mt. Gox management.?

MtGox boss Mark Karpeles has been targeted by hackers following the company's recent bankruptcy protection filing .
The Bitcoin magnate's personal blog and Reddit account were breached, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.

The leaked material includes an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million transactions, entries from the firm's business ledger and details about its admin software.
""It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" said the hackers in a statement accompanying the data dump.
MtGox went dark last month after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around ?210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole.
It remains unclear whether the information leaked by hackers was genuine and sheds any light on the incident, according to Forbes .

So Where Are Mt Gox's Stolen Bitcoin Millions?
Now anonymous hackers believe they have the answer ? they're still in Mt Gox. ""On Sunday,"" reports Forbes , ""hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox?s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users.""
The blog has since been taken down, but the hackers' message is available on Pastebin . ""It?s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.""
The message provides a link to a zip file. ""Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""
The hackers also provide what they claim to be the balances of virtual currencies still existent ?? and it includes more than 950,000 bitcoins. This alone is proof of nothing. Forbes points out, ""I couldn?t verify that Sunday?s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox?s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins?that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.""
Nevertheless, the lack of movement for the stolen bitcoins has puzzled the community. On Friday, however, writing in Coindesk , Danny Bradbury noted that a wallet most likely owned by Mt Gox had started to be active. This wallet had been dormant until July 2012, when it started receiving small transactions. ""However,"" writes Bradbury, ""no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totaling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million).""
Since then, he continues, ""these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins.""
Why this is happening is not so clear. ""One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions,"" suggests Bradbury. Another possibility, of course, is that it also makes them harder to trace.?
It is not absolutely clear that the bitcoins concerned are still 'owned' by Mt Gox, but bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell suggests they are. ""Maxwell also argued that the splitting behavior is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox,"" writes Bradbury. ""This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said.""
One thing is clear: the Mt Gox debacle is still posing more questions than it is providing answers.

Hackers Claim to Have Evidence of Fraud Surrounding Mt. Gox Closure,http://socialtimes.com/hackers-claim-evidence-fraud-surrounding-mtgox-closure_b144468,Social Times \(blog\),"Share
*Mark Karpeles, CEO Mt. Gox (Bloomberg)
A group of hackers told Forbes that they?ve broken into Mt. Gox servers in order to bring to light what actually happened in the days leading up to the company?s bankruptcy filing, which left its customers without hundreds of millions of bitcoins. Mt. Gox has not been forthcoming with the Bitcoin community apart from attributing the closure to a massive hacker attack.
?Hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox?s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users,? said Forbes. Reddit moderators removed the hackers? post soon after it was posted saying that stolen material was not permitted in the subforum, but the community had already been drawing its own conclusions.
In its three-year history, Mt. Gox customers experienced technical difficulties so often ? delayed trades, suspended withdrawals and offline issues ? that users started using the term ?goxed? to describe user issues: ?You?ve been goxed!?
The hackers accessed a massive database and 716 megabyte file detailing over a million trades, among other things , and posted it to Karpeles? personal website. According to Forbes: ?In the hackers? summary of Mt. Gox?s balances in various currencies, they point to a claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they take as evidence that Mark Karpeles? claim to have lost users? digital currency to hackers is fraudulent. ?That fat fuck has been lying!!? a note in the file reads.?
Bitcoin experts haven?t seen the movement of the 850,000 bitcoins that Mt. Gox claims to have lost in its bankruptcy filing. The coins should be accessible on the public transaction ledger meant to prevent fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy.
Forbes reporter, Andy Greenberg , said that as of yet he has been unable to verify the hackers? claims. ?I couldn?t verify that Sunday?s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the ?lying? that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox?s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins ? that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.?

Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key
Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.
They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox?s claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.
Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.
[ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ]
Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.
Karpeles? blog was titled ?Magical Tux in Japan?Geekness brought me to Japan!? Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname ?MagicalTux? when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline on Sunday shortly after it was attacked.
A screenshot of Karpeles' hacked blog. (Click to enlarge; strong language.)
Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.
The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users? personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.
The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles? CV and a Windows executable called ?TibanneBackOffice,? among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.
The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.
Mt. Gox?s demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin?s public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.
One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.
Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.
The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin?s core software who?ve said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.
Follow the money
Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.
The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user?s public bitcoin ?address? or ?wallet,? which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.
Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox?s bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.
In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.
At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.
The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million.
Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.
?There?s a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it?s very, very difficult, and it?s tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it?s just obvious,? he said.
The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.
An academic pape r published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.
?For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,? they wrote.
Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.
?A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,? said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. ?This is serious money for serious people.?
Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.
If that?s the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.

Why I Do Not Trust Bitcoin,http://seekingalpha.com/article/2077823-why-i-do-not-trust-bitcoin\?source=google_news,Seeking Alpha,"Medium-term horizon, ETF investing, industrials, fundamental analysis
Summary
Bitcoin?s volatility makes it an unreliable medium for financial transactions.
A Bitcoin-generated free market system becomes an inherently adversarial process, pitting the best interests of the buyer against the best interests of the seller.
Rising concerns about the security of the Bitcoin software indicate that its economic system is vulnerable to externalities.
Bitcoin may actually violate the principles of the free market economy that it purports to establish.
There are two ways to look at Bitcoin: as an investment opportunity and as a virtual currency. As an investment, one is buying ""shares"" in a pecuniary transaction system - a software-driven enterprise developed to provide users with a regulation-free, totally ""libertarian,"" economy. As a virtual economy, Bitcoin provides a currency (the bitcoin), the value of which is mediated by the marketplace, rather than by a government, and that is not subject to legislative control and political manipulation.1
The beautiful simplicity of the whole concept is that the two functions - investment and currency - are bound inextricably in the same instrumentality: the bitcoin. In this way, the value of a bitcoin is tied to the desirability of participating in the Bitcoin economic system; that the value of a bitcoin is tied to its desirability is essentially guaranteed by the fact that, ultimately, there will be only 21 million bitcoins in existence, and with constancy of supply, the only variable in the worth of the ""commodity"" (the bitcoin) is its desirability (or, its demand).2
I have a problem with Bitcoin. It would seem that one should be disinclined to place one's trust in a ""currency"" the value of which is fundamentally dependent upon the enthusiasm of its adherents. Because of the volatility in a bitcoin's value, it introduces a measure of unfairness into the marketplace. That unfairness, coupled with growing concerns about security issues within the Bitcoin system seems to make Bitcoin an inferior alternative to fiat currencies.
The Subjective Value of Bitcoins
Fiat currency (such as the U.S. dollar) derives its value from the fact that it has a government backing it up. The government establishes and guarantees the value of the currency it issues. It is the stability in its assigned objective value that enables the fiat currency to be used as a transactional medium.
The pecuniary worth of bitcoins is based on subjective value - that is, their value is dependent upon what the bitcoin purchaser is willing to pay for it, and that subjective value is a complex assemblage of personal attitudes that contribute to the deliberative process as one decides just what value one is willing to assign to the bitcoin.
The responsibility for the variability in the monetary value of bitcoins is the conflation of monetary value with investment price that occurs in Bitcoin. The resultant valuation of bitcoins, thus, tends to be subject to periods of volatility. Consider the following chart3, which traces bitcoin price from July 18, 2010 through March 5, 2014:
On July 18, 2010, a bitcoin was worth $0.09, and on December 4, 2013, that same bitcoin was worth $1,147.25 - a 1.25-million percent increase in value. Barely more than three months later, on March 5, 2014, that bitcoin was worth $661.79 - a 43% drop from the December high. Serious fluctuations in the value of bitcoins did not occur until early 2013.
Bitcoin Transactions
If all bitcoins had a standard value, there would be no question but that any transaction involving bitcoins would be fair and equitable. If, for instance, bitcoins were worth $500.00 (and set at that value), buying a bitcoin would be a matter of paying $500 to the bitcoin exchange and getting the one-bitcoin amount added to one's account. A person buying something for $100 would spend 20% of his bitcoin's value to do so, and the seller would receive 20% of a bitcoin's value in exchange for the item sold.
It should be noted that all bitcoin transactions take place in terms of the fiat currency in which the seller participates - to effect the transaction, the current value of a bitcoin must be determined, the amount needed to conduct the transaction is determined, that amount is transferred from the buyer's account to the seller's account, once in the seller's account it is registered as (a portion of) a bitcoin.4
Since all bitcoins (in the scenario) are of a standard value, all transactions would be like this - both buyer and seller would be conducting business under purely equitable currency valuations. In the kind of transaction described above, the bitcoin functions - for all intents and purposes - like a fiat currency.
Unfortunately, a transaction such as the one described can only occur in reality if (1) both buyer and seller acquired their bitcoins at the same price, and (2) the transaction takes place at a time when bitcoins are valued at the same price as that at which both buyer and seller acquired theirs.
Transactional Dilemma, Part I: Let the Buyer Beware
In the ""real"" world of the virtual currency, however, the value of a bitcoin changes - literally from one minute to the next. A person (""X"") buys a bitcoin at the rate of $550.00 per bitcoin. Later that day, X visits a local electronics store that transacts in bitcoin, and finds an excellent Tablet PC for $275.00. A quick calculation informs him that that is one-half bitcoin at the rate at which he made his recent purchase.
Transaction 1: As X informs the seller (""Y"") that he wants to buy the tablet using bitcoin, Y begins the transaction. It is discovered that at the time of the transaction, the bitcoin is worth only $500.00 - an approximately 9% loss of value in terms of dollars. This being the case, the tablet will cost X 55% of his bitcoin, essentially a 10% increase in price compared to the original purchase price of the bitcoin (55% of the original bitcoin value is $302.50).
Transaction 2: Of course, things could work out differently for X. Suppose, as the transaction is taking place, the value of a bitcoin is $600.00 - a 9% increase in bitcoin value. In this case, X pays just over 45% of a bitcoin, and since 45% of the original bitcoin value equals $247.50, X gets what amounts to a 10% discount on the tablet.
Based on the above considerations, we can generalize: The Buyer should always prefer to transact when his bitcoins are worth more than he paid for them (i.e., when bitcoins have appreciated in value).
Transactional Dilemma, Part II: Seller's Remorse
Things work quite differently for the seller in our example. Y does business in U.S. currency, so for him, there is no preference in terms of the bitcoin rate at the time of the transaction with X (at least, on the face of it).5 We may suppose that Y has a profit margin of 5% on his electronic equipment, so that the sale of the tablet represents a profit of $13.75; the remaining $261.25 represents fixed costs (his cost for the tablet, plus overheads).
Transaction 1a: According to the above scenario for transaction 1, Y receives .55 bitcoin. At some point, Y will want to exchange his bitcoin for fiat currency, either for his own use or to use for business expenses. Suppose that when he goes to exchange the .55 bitcoin he received from X the exchange rate has dropped to $475.00. In this case, Y's bitcoin is worth $261.25 - the 5% drop in the bitcoin rate has effectively eliminated Y's profit for the tablet.6
Transaction 1b: Suppose that the exchange rate for Y has gone up since the sale, and bitcoins are valued at $525.00. Y's .55 bitcoin is now worth $288.75. After accounting for his fixed costs, Y is left with a profit of $27.50, or double his usual profit.
Transaction 2a: In transaction 2, above, Y receives .45 bitcoin. If the exchange rate is $475.00 when Y seeks to collect his dollars, he realizes only $213.75 - not only costing him his profit, but also causing him an additional loss of $47.50, or 18% of his fixed costs.
Transaction 2b: Now suppose that the exchange rate for the bitcoin is $525.00. Y's .45 bitcoin is worth $236.25 - certainly more than he realizes in 2a, but he still loses not only his profit, but comes up $25.00 short in covering his fixed expenses (an almost 10% loss).
Generalizing on these considerations: It is always in the Seller's interest to seek the greatest amount of bitcoin in any transaction (i.e., transact when bitcoins have depreciated in value).
The Adversarial Economy
It is a principle of free markets that buyer and seller meet and come to a mutually agreed-upon basis for exchange. Fundamental to the concept of such an exchange is that there is some way that the needs of the seller and the needs of the buyer can be made compatible. If that compatibility cannot be achieved, the transaction does not take place (at least, in principle).
In light of the set of examples I've just presented and the two generalizations that were drawn therefrom, it would seem to follow that Bitcoin, as it is currently conceived, may not produce a truly free market wherein both buyer and seller can come to agreement as to the conditions of a transaction. It will always be in the interest of the buyer to transact with the highest valuation achievable of the transactional medium (the bitcoin), and it will always be in the interest of the seller to transact with the lowest valuation achievable of that same medium.
In short, it would seem that a Bitcoin economy would be - as it is currently conceived - an adversarial economy, where buyer and seller are both committed to strategies that are mutually incompatible and would inhibit the possibility of reaching the agreement that characterizes a free market.
I believe that the reason Bitcoin economics reaches this fundamental standoff is because it seems not to acknowledge an important aspect of investment: cost basis. Any rational investor is bound to consider the costs involved in making an investment. That cost basis is the measure against which capital gains (and losses) are determined, and - ultimately - what determines whether the investment was worth the undertaking. And since Bitcoin is both an investment and a system of currency, it needs to be mindful of the expectations people have both as investors and as participants.
What it costs the individual to partake in a particular investment is part and parcel of the ultimate rationality of pursuing that investment. To ignore the relevance of cost basis is to neglect the very fundamental principle upon which the acceptability of free market economics is dependent: it is always rational for an individual to be motivated to seek the maximum gains for the minimum costs. Like it or not, in its current form, Bitcoin is fundamentally anchored to fiat currencies inasmuch as those currencies are the means by which Bitcoin acquires its users and conducts transactions.
Summary and Addendum about Security
The considerations I have presented are products of my thinking. I may be wrong on some things, but I think not. In any event, it is important that potential and current investors in Bitcoin have access to all information available, and that they be exposed to various perspectives of the Bitcoin enterprise. It is not my intention to discourage anyone from participating in the Bitcoin enterprise.
Since the fiasco of Mt. Gox, it has become clear that there are serious security issues to be had with the software that serves as the foundation for Bitcoin. One such issue is transaction malleability, which involves the manipulation of the digital signatures that are used to generate the IDs that identify each transaction occurring on the Bitcoin network. By doing so, transactions can be ""lost,"" with a resultant loss of bitcoin. Bitcoin programmers have known about malleability issues since 2011, but have not been able to completely eradicate the problem as yet.7
On March 5, 2014, it was reported that two bitcoin sites suffered significant losses of digital currency by flooding accounts with transfers between users' accounts before the accounts could be updated; the thieves would then close out their own account (loaded with the transferred coins). Canadian bitcoin bank, Flexcoin suffered the loss of all of its digital currency with a total value approaching $600,000.00; Flexcoin has gone out of business. Poloniex, another bitcoin exchange, lost 12.3% of its digital currency; Poloniex plans to devalue all users' accounts by 12.3%, since precise records indicating which accounts actually lost coinage have not been found.8
Given the security issues that seem to be becoming rife with the open-source software, it seems to some degree irresponsible to attempt to continue doing business. Further, given the fact that open-source software can be altered by users, it would seem to be difficult, if not impossible, to guarantee that all users in the system can be made secure - at least, until standardized software is developed that addresses the security issues and is made mandatory for all users.
It is no wonder that it is now possible to ""short"" bitcoin, just as one could short any currency.9
1 I follow the convention of using the word ""Bitcoin"" (capital ""B"") to refer to the system, and the word ""bitcoin"" (small ""b"") to refer to the currency.
2 Alternatively, it is considered a serious flaw of Bitcoin by Anthony Alfidi here that constancy of supply will result in a stagnant economy, because Bitcoin would be unable to generate new capital for growth. I think it is not as limited as some might argue. If the value of a bitcoin is dependent upon its desirability, even if the number of bitcoins is constant, their value should be variable according to the elasticity of demand.
3 The data used in constructing the chart is from CoinDesk, here .
4 This is admittedly a rough characterization. The bitcoin transactions I refer to are according to bitpay.com , a company that provides merchants with the software and data needed to conduct bitcoin transactions. The price is what bitpay.com calls its ""Bitcoin Best Bid"" (""BBB"") - the best rate available from exchanges with ""adequate liquidity"" and withdrawal capability in the U.S. and eurozone. Rates are updated every minute.
5 A quick survey of some of the websites that will accept bitcoin as payment shows that they list their prices in dollars, relying on a transaction facilitator (such as bitpay.com) to manage bitcoin transactions for them.
6 Please note that in all of these transactions, I do not include transaction fees. While the absence of fees is often used as a selling point for Bitcoin, it is understood that exchanges and other intermediaries are free to charge for their services. A quick review showed that most agencies do charge a small service fee for at least some services.
7 Danny Bradbury, for instance, discusses this issue for CoinDesk, here ; it has also been acknowledged by Gavin Andresen of the Bitcoin Foundation in his blog, here .
8 Information about the ""withdrawal vulnerabilities"" at the facilities is described by Lucian Constantin for PCWorld, here ; details of Poloniex's recovery strategy are outlined by Cyrus Farivar for ars technica, here .
9 The process must be undertaken using an exchange that will transfer between bitcoins and other currencies, and the process is described here .

Mt. Gox CEO's personal blog hacked,http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2014/03/mt-gox-ceos-personal-blog-hacked.html,Washington Business Journal \(blog\),
Mt Gox Customers Hack Karpales' Account to Post Evidence of Alleged Fraud,http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/132788-Mt-Gox-Customers-Hack-Karpales-Account-to-Post-Evidence-of-Alleged-Fraud,The Escapist,"28 ?
But don't go clicking any links found in the spreadsheet the hackers posted, for There Be Trojans.
Update: Mt Gox has filed for US bankruptcy protection. CEO Karpales says, in the statement accompanying the bankruptcy protection documents , that it would ""allow Mt Gox a necessary breathing period for it to focus on its restructuring efforts without the distraction that would result if certain litigation currently pending in the United States were allowed to proceed.""
According to Karpales, Mt Gox has $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets. Karpales also claims that the hack which took down Mt Gox stole approximately 7% of the world's Bitcoin supply.
Source: Ars Technica
Original Story:
One of the things that's been puzzling the Bitcoin community is, if the Mt Gox wallet really was emptied by person or persons unknown, where did all the coins go? You'd think a transaction of that size would show up in the public ledger of transactions, runs the theory. Those of you following all things Bitcoin related may remember that other self-appointed investigators followed a very similar theory searching for Sheep Marketplace's Bitcoin, with dismal results . Now some of Mt Gox's customers have hacked the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpales, posting what they claim is evidence of fraud. Or, as they prefer to put it, evidence that they've been Goxed.
The hackers posted messages, since removed from Karpales' blog and Reddit, claiming that they had discovered where Karpales stored the loot. The hackers claim Karpales kept back 951,116 Bitcoin, though this claim may not be all it seems.
For one, as Forbes points out, the spreadsheet posted by the hackers may simply indicate how badly Mt Gox dropped the ball; that all those figures show is what Mt Gox thought it had, not what it actually possessed.
For another, the information posted seems to be infested with Trojans . The posts included genuine Mt Gox data mixed in with a healthy helping of .exe and Mac.app files, some of which are actually Bitcoin stealing viruses disguised as back office tools. Should you go looking for the files yourself, you're advised not to open them.
One poster says that the data was obtained by installing a rootkit months ago on one of Mt Gox's servers via known Gentoo Linux distribution flaws, and the installation was successful because Karpales didn't bother to update. This same poster, nanashi, claimed to have access to much of Mt Gox's customer data in a 20GB stolen database, possibly including bank details, passwords, usernames, even passport scans. Nanashi offered this database for sale for 100 Bitcoin.  ""Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure,"" he says.

Former Macquarie banker Joe Lee and Wall Street investment adviser George Samman suspected something was wrong with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox in the closing months of 2013.
The founders behind Singapore-based derivatives trader BTC.sx had begun withdrawing money as early as December, fearing the premium Mt.Gox users paid for Bitcoins was a sign of liquidity issues at the Tokyo-based exchange.
But it didn?t stop Lee and?Samman from sustaining a six-figure loss when Mt.Gox finally went under last month.
?We were one of Mt.Gox?s biggest customers but we got no inside ?information from them at all,"" says ?Samman, chief operating officer at the trader. ?They couldn?t answer any questions so it was useless. We were lucky to get off what we needed to get off before the whole thing went down.""

In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox.

Series of Bitcoin problems
The failure of Bitcoin?s most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin?s mysterious creator,?Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).
For a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US ?dollars to the thousands in just five years ? to be worth $US10 billion at its height ? the loss of 744,000?Bitcoins (worth $527?million at Monday?s average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service.
And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system?s code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox?s former chief
Mark Karpeles
, publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1?million.
The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox?s collapse is more?fraud than theft, but provides ?little hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned.
In an email trail seen by?The Australian Financial Review between ?Kloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the?exchange admitted it was unable to?process ?Bitcoin withdrawals quickly?due to difficulty dealing with major banks.
It?s a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed.
?It?s still quite difficult to buy ?Bitcoins,"" says Parrish, a software en?gineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges,?Parrish buys and sells ?Bitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders.
Average price steady
However, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox?s failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox?s own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its?price remains volatile but it seems?those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it. ?People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin,""?says ?Samman. ?But I think it?s a short-term negative and long-term positive.
?You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past.""
Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned ?Bitcoin while China has restricted how?banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in?New York float the idea of a ?Bitcoin licence.
No plans for Australian regulations
In Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor
Glenn Stevens
told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was ?not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator"".
?We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks,"" he said. ?It is a potential alternative currency so how it will hold its value is the first question. There have been countless currencies through history and the ones that survive are the ones that hold value.""
Samman says BTC.sx will join the list of 127,000?creditors seeking retribution from Mt.Gox but is unsure how regulators will even tackle a corporation that deals in assets that countries do not yet?recognise.
?They probably will have to tread on very careful water, the judges or whoever is involved in this bankruptcy because if they frame it in a certain way they may get a legal precedent for the legitimacy of Bitcoin,""?he says.
